Warranties apply against manufacturer defects.Bone Product DescriptionThe Bone is our first and most popular creeper model, an American made product to ease the woes of mechanics worldwide. Originally called theCaptain Creeperwhen it was invented in 1974, its unique shape led it to be renamed asThe Bone&trade;&nbsp; when it went on sale to the public in 1996. Since then it has become a standard for quality in the creeper industry, and is widely asked for by name. Most importantly, however, is the fact that all of our creepers are American made, in a world where so many formerly American products have had their production moved overseas.The Bone features a uniquely shaped body which cradles the user between the wheels only an inch or so above the ground. The big, easy rolling wheels are positioned outboard to provide a strong, stable working platform that can&rsquo;t tip or flip the user. The rib-reinforced body is molded of a state-of-the-art, engineering grade co-polymer that resists the effects of common solvents, so cleaning is quick and easy at the end of the job. The smooth, comfortable one-piece design has no cracks, corners or other pinch points, and the outboard wheel pods prevent tipping and flipping.The Bone&trade;body is a patented design which allows the use of large diameter wheels with specially formulated tires that roll easily over all sorts of obstacles, including rough floors, drop cords and air lines, loose parts and even tools and floor grates. The wheels are fastened to the creeper body with four 5/16-inch diameter. thru-bolts so they can&rsquo;t pull tear out or break off in any common use situation.One of the most important features of the Bone is its wheels. Ordinary creeper wheels are a conventional creeper&rsquo;s weakest point. They&rsquo;re too small, so they get hung up or stopped by even the tiniest obstacles, and they have a real knack for tearing out or breaking off at the worst moment. To add insult to injury, the replacement wheels can cost almost as much as a new creeper.The Bone has custom-molded, 5-1/8-inch diameter wheels with oil-impregnated center bearings and specially formulated, molded-in-place 1-inch wide tires that roll even easier and last even longer than the previous design. The heavy American made cad-plated steel caster frames have dual race ball bearing swivels and are thru-bolted to the creeper body. In addition, the winged design adds form to function.

It is an American made product priced to compete directly with other plastic creepers on the market, but blows them out of the water with its high quality, reliable, strong construction. The first thing you notice about the &#x201C;Bone-ster&#x2122;&#x201D; is a strong family resemblance, the patented dog-bone shape that cradles the user between the wheels, about 1-1/4&#x201D; above the ground. It&#x2019;s a proven design that&#x2019;s more durable, more comfortable, less likely to tip and easier to work on than any other creeper on the market.  The second &#x201C;Bone-ster&#x2122;&#x201D; feature to catch your attention is the unique one-piece body that&#x2019;s molded of the same special engineering-grade co-polymer as the original Bone&#x2122;. It is smooth, comfortable, easy to clean, resistant to gasoline, oil and almost all common solvents, and covered by a limited one-year warranty. The deep, smoothly molded structural ribs add incredible strength and durability without adding bulk & weight; providing welcome ventilation for those hot muggy days when lying on a vinyl pad leaves you with a sweaty back and a bad attitude! Two molded-in handholds make it easy to carry and easy to secure against theft or serial tool borrowers. Best of all, the &#x201C;Bone-ster&#x2122;&#x201D; solves the most common creeper complaint &#x2013; wheels that break! Every &#x201C;Bone-ster&#x2122;&#x201D; features incredibly strong, custom-molded wheels that are guaranteed for as long as you own the creeper (against manufacturer defects)! Wheels are 3&#x201D; dia. with oil-impregnated metal center bearings and a molded-in-place 7/8&#x201D; wide tire that resists oil, gas and most common solvents. Using this advanced technology the tires form a strong molecular bond to the wheels, essentially becoming a strong one-piece wheel. Heavy gauge, cad-plated steel caster frames have dual race ball bearing swivels and each one is thru-bolted to the body with four 1/4&#x201D; dia. bolts that won&#x2019;t ever tear off, strip out or fall apart.

This film is installed on the fender before the mud flap is added to protect your vehicle's paint. Our mud guards are manufactured from highly durable, impact resistant thermoplastic.

Sal Suds is not soap-based and is formulated especially for all-purpose hard-surface cleaning. Perfect for general household cleaning: dishes floors laundry etc. Equally effective in hard or soft water rinsing freely hot or cold. Concentrated and self-preserving: no hidden preservatives or ingredients. No synthetic dyes or fragrances: all ingredients fully disclosed and described. Biodegrades rapidly after doing its job. Pure high-quality fir and spruce essential oils: no cheap harsh pine stump oil. No animal testing: Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics certified.Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS): This surfactant cuts grease and dirt, generates copious suds, and biodegrades quickly and completely. SLS is made by combining a sulfate group with lauryl alcohol from coconut oil, then attaching sodium. If improperly formulated, SLS can irritate skin, but our superb formula uses coco-betaine and lauryl glucoside to counter this. Coco-Betaine: Mild and easily biodegradable, coco-betaine is formed by combining coconut fatty acids with betaine (a nature-identical synthetic so-named because it was first discovered in sugar beets). This foam-boosting cleansing agent buffers irritation caused by SLS. Lauryl Glucoside: This powerful grease-cutting surfactant is especially mild and quickly biodegradable, and is made by combining glucose from corn with fatty alcohols from coconut and palm kernel oils. Lauryl glucoside not only works with SLS to cut dirt and oily soils with exceptional ease, but also combines with coco-betaine to give Sal Suds smooth mildness. Fir Needle Oil & Spruce Oil: Pure essential oils from fir and spruce give Sal Suds its wonderful aroma. Most other cleansers use synthetic fragrances or cheap harsh pine stump oil.",Dr. Bronner

They're designed to fit such popular vehicles as &frac34; ton and one-ton pickup trucks, many Class A, B &amp; C motor homes, and commercial trucks and other severe uses.Application InformationThis LoadLifter 5000 kit, number 57215, fits many different pickup applications. Always use the Part Finder to check that the kit fits your vehicle. This kit can be easily installed in around 2 hours.LoadLifter 5000Fully adjustable, LoadLifter 5000 kits have real air muscle, and keep your vehicle riding level and comfortable with no load, loaded, or towing on any road condition. Air Lift&rsquo;s toughest air helper springs, they have up to 5,000 pounds of leveling capacity, right up to the manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended Gross Vehicle Weight Rating, and are air adjustable from 5 to 100 PSI. Rugged and durable, the superior 2-ply fabric reinforced air springs are built like a tire. Ultra high-strength Zytel nylon end caps &ndash; strong as steel, but less heavy, and corrosion proof &ndash; complete the air springs. Your kit will also include Air Lift&rsquo;s exclusive upper and lower roll plates that increase load capacity by 10 percent and protect the air spring from sharp edges such as brackets, etc. All kits are engineered to be easy to install and come with a fully illustrated instruction manual.Why Air?Factory suspensions must compromise between ride comfort and load hauling capacity. Soft factory suspensions can&rsquo;t carry heavy loads, and heavy steel springs ride rough, especially when the vehicle is unloaded. Only air springs can support your heavy loads and provide a great ride. Air Lift adjustable air springs solve these common problems by allowing you to tune your suspension under all load and road conditions. Just add air when towing or hauling and then remove air for a softer ride when unloaded.Eliminate these common load and towing problems for good when you use Air Lift air springs:Sag &ndash; Proper weight distribution to all tires improves steering, braking and tire wear. This is especially important while towing: adjust the air springs to accept the tongue weight of the trailer or other heavy loads.Headlight aim &ndash; Only level and stable vehicles provide safe and proper headlight aiming &ndash; critical for night driving safety.Rough ride &ndash; Air Lift's progressive spring rate soaks up bumps, keeping tires on the road for better handling.Bottoming out &ndash; Air Lift springs restore normal ride height when heavily loaded or towing, reducing suspension wear and eliminating crashing on bumps.Sway and body roll &ndash; Air springs increase spring rate and vastly improve vehicle stability. When towing trailers, the air springs permit precise vehicle height adjustment for exact alignment, reducing trailer sway. Less roll and sway means a safer and more comfortable ride.Porpoising &ndash; Even heavy pickups which don&rsquo;t squat when loaded can begin to ""porpoise"" vertically when towing heavy trailers. Progressive rate air springs dramatically reduce this problem for a safer, more comfortable ride.Suggested AccessoriesFor maximum convenience and leveling on-the-go, nothing beats an Air Lift on board air compressor system. Automatic or dash-mounted, it quickly adjusts your vehicle for changes in load or road conditions.

The Crystal Pad, the sanding material in this kit, has been used to polish plastic surfaces for over 20 years in the aircraft industry. It has a thin layer of soft resilient material between the back and the abrasive crystals which provides a cushion for the abrasives. Using a cushion design allows the relatively large abrasive crystals to recede into the resilient layer and float to an even cutting plane. The Crystal Pad produces a fine, even scratch pattern. It does not leave deep, random scratches as with common abrasives. It cuts rapidly because of its large crystal design and because more of the abrasive is in contact with the workpiece. The Crystal Pad outlasts common abrasives because the large abrasive crystals do not load up, generate heat, or fracture into the workpiece. In dry applications it outlasts common abrasives 5-7 times and when wet, 7-15 times, making it economical to use.",Lifegard

No other digital ignition can match the power and efficiency of the all new MSD Digital-6 Plus.MSD combines race winning experience with cutting edge technology to create the most powerful Digital Ignition available. The Digital-6 Plus is Digital Done Right.The heart of the Digital-6 Plus Ignition is a 15 Megahertz microcontroller, the fastest of all digital ignitions. What this means is the controller analyzes up to 15,000,000 critical instructions per second. This is over three times the speed of comparable ignitions and produces the most accurate trigger signals, timing and rev limits possible.MSD engineers have spent an endless amount of time testing the components of the Digital-6 Plus to ensure the most efficient and reliable operation. The 6 Plus produces more power with less current draw (20% less) by incorporating an IGBT coil driver that can be controlled for improved coil saturation. Also, power MOSFET technology and high frequency magnetic converters require less input current while producing more energy and voltage.Every spark of the Digital-6 Plus ignition is packed with 135 millijoules of spark energy and up to 535 volts. When used with the MSD Blaster HVC Coil, PN 8252, a spark with over 300 milliamps burns across the plug gap for 400 microseconds. Below 3,300 rpm the Digital-6 Plus produces a series of sparks that glows in the cylinder for up to 20&#xB0; of crankshaft rotation. This incredible heat ensures combustion to produce great power, quick throttle response, smooth idle and quick starts.To prevent any chance of Electro Magnetic Interference (EMI) a filter circuit is made up of state-of-the-art magnetic suppressor components. This, combined with the more than competent microcontroller, checks and rechecks inputs many times to determine ""clean"" signals before making any compensations. The magnetic input also features a unique micro-controlled feedback circuit for total EMI-free operation.FEATURESAdjustable rotary switches in 100 rpm increments.Single stage retard for nitrous and top end performance.LED display warns of trigger signal problems or faulty charging system.Polyurethane Potted for vibration/ water protectionC.A.R.B ApprovedSPECIFICATIONSOperating Voltage:  12-18 volts, neg. ground (Full voltage output down 7 volts supply)Current Draw:  0.7 amps per 1,000 rpm (7.2 amps) with 14V bat. @ 10,000 rpmRPM Range:  12,500 rpm with 14.4 volt supplySpark Duration:  20&#xB0; crankshaft rotation thru 3,300 rpmSpark Energy:  135 millijoules per sparkWeight and Size:  3.7 lbs, 8.5""L x 4.5""W x 2.2""HVoltage Output Max:  Primary: 535 Volts delivered to coil, Secondary: 45,000 Volts (MSD HVC Coil)",MSD

This easily installed Fender Mount Towing Mirror is perfect for a multi-vehicle owner with its easily adjustable arms and no tool installation. It can easily attach and detach according to the need of the vehicle. The Fender Mount Towing Mirror does initially require some light assembly. This mirror consists of six components, but once you have it together it is pretty easy to adjust and install. The Fender Mount Mirror sits over the top of the fender. The mirror attaches using three bracket arms. The bracket arms contain hooks that are rubber coated to protect the finish on your vehicle. The top arms of the bracket system go onto the hood line, where it meets the fender. The hooks will not interfere with the opening and closing of the hood. The hook on the bottom grabs below the bottom edge of the fender. This mirror works best with fenders that are all metal and do not have plastic trim. The mirror head is able to adjust up, down, and side to side utilizing a ball and socket design. The arm that holds up the mirror head is also rotatable. You can loosen the knob on the arm and position the mirror head anywhere you need it. This is a relatively clean installation on your vehicle.

Vehicles with rearview mirrors that contain integrated controls such as OnStar, or digital displays for compass/temperature may not be compatible due to height. The mirror might also interfere with the use of dual map lights, but can easily be removed and remounted in seconds without the need for any tools. The quick mount system is also great for transferring the mirror from vehicle to vehicle. Warning: due to its convex design, objects in this mirror may be closer than they appear.

Our semi-custom program uses Block-It Series non-woven protection fabrics made by Kimberly-Clark in the U.S.A. The 200 Series fabric covers offer different levels of protection to fit your needs and budget. Block-It 200 Series fabric uses 3-layer polypropylene construction for moisture and dust resistance, and the fabrics are treated for extra UV resistance.  Standard covers can be used outdoors on a limited basis against moisture, but because the fabric is breathable, any moisture or condensation can easily evaporate. They make excellent dust covers for indoor storage and the extra UV resistance in the fabric assures good service when used outdoors. Key Points: Lightweight - Easy to use, and less bulky for compact storage. Soft & Non-Abrasive - Will not scratch paint. Breathable - Allows moisture and condensation to evaporate. Moisture, Mold & UV Resistant - Polypropylene fibers are naturally moisture resistant and treated for extra UV protection. Good Dust Protection - When used indoors, keeps vehicle cleaner than most woven fabrics. Two (2) Year Limited Warranty - Against defects in workmanship and/or the fabric becoming serviceable during normal use.",Covercraft

Lubegard's bio-tech engine oil protectant contains liquid wax ester (LXE) technology. It is the lubrication system of the future. All modern engine oils contain a highly refined petroleum or synthetic base oil which is fortified with additives to meet motor oil performance specifications. Even so, dated specifications may not represent the level of performance needed by a new engine design. A new oil may not contain sufficient additives such as anti-wear agents or anti corrosion compounds even though it passes all the tests. These protective compounds are depleted when the oil is in service. The solution to this protection gap is Lubegard bio-tech engine oil protectant which supplements and enhances the effectiveness of the additive system already present in the oil. It replaces the depleted or insufficient additives and adds LXE wear protectors and friction reducers which are unavailable in any oil. Minimum friction means maximum mileage; minimum wear means maximum service. In addition, Lubegard increases the thermal and oxidative stability of motor oil to prevent creation of sludge and deposits. Lubegard with LXE technology will carry your engine through to the future.",Lubegard

It gives a natural, non-greasy treatment to both new and older leather. A special fragrance enhances the aroma of leather. Duragloss leather conditioner naturally enhances the appearance of leather by rejuvenating the fibers with mink oil and lanolin. Mink oil has been used for centuries to treat and preserve leather because it is a natural moisturizer. Combined with lanolin, a key ingredient in many face lotions, mink oil nourishes leather deep down to restore its supple feel and luxurious appearance. Duragloss leather conditioner is not oily or greasy. It penetrates into the leather, rather than sitting on top. The non-greasy finish will not attract dust or soil. It leaves leather feeling softer and looking fresher. Use Duragloss leather conditioner on new leather to maintain its appearance or on older leather to restore its softness and flexibility. By starting a leather treatment routine early, one can prevent the drying and cracking that occurs as the leather ages. Duragloss leather conditioner is an important step towards maintaining your vehicle's leather interior over the life of your car. First, use Duragloss leather shampoo to clean leather without removing its natural oils. Then apply Duragloss leather conditioner using a clean Cobra microfiber applicator. Soften, moisturize, and preserve your vehicle's fine leather interior naturally with Duragloss leather conditioner.",Duragloss
