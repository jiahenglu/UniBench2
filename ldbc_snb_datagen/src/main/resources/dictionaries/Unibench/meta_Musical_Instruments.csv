His first two books Jazz Saxophone Etudes Vol. 1 and Jazz Saxophone Duets, both received critical acclaim by teachers and players alike. James Moody, Jerry Coker, Plas Johnson, Mark Colby, Gary Campbell and Bob Sheppard as well as the late Michael Brecker have all shared their praise for Fishman s books. The previous released Jazz Saxophone Etudes Volume 2 continued along the same path as his inaugural book. Greg Fishman s publications are outstanding gems with comprehensive information from explanation to play-along. Not only is the information there for the taking but also Fishman s demonstrations on both tenor and alto saxophone are swinging and flawless. His sound and pitch is something any teacher should have absolutely no trouble telling a student to use as a model while playing along at home. Fishman sounds equally adept on both the alto and tenor saxophone voices. The two newest books will find their place among saxophonists who are newer to the word of jazz. Jazz Saxophone Etudes Volume 3 and Jazz Phrasing for Beginners by Greg Fishman offer the intermediate and beginner students the same quality of etudes as his first three books. Volume 3 feels much like Volume 1 and 2 however the tempos are decidedly and intentionally slower for younger or less advanced students. The addition of some bossa novas offer a pleasant contrast not present in his first two etude books. In the preface to of his latest book, Fishman writes, Jazz Phrasing for Beginners is a prequel to my series of intermediate and advanced jazz education books. They are not dumbed down but come out of an entirely different approach. Later he writes, I decided to take a different approach and write simple, catchy tunes with clear melodic development that stand alone as good pieces of music, period, rather than trying to write a simplified version of one of my more advanced pieces. He certainly succeeded. Each of the new jazz etudes is again named after a different street in Chicago a nice tribute to the place he was born back in 1967. Fishman has been playing professionally since age 14 and earned a Masters in Jazz Pedagogy from Northwestern University. Neither of these accomplishments is lost on the etudes. The ideas presented in this book and those before it represent a dedication to the music called Jazz. The two CDs, one each for alto and tenor, feature Fishman along with Dennis Luxion on piano, Eric Hochberg on bass and Phil Gratteau on drums. The world-class rhythm section swings hard as Fishman demonstrates each etude succinctly and with great precision. There are many composers, saxophonists, and educators out there who possess these three unique abilities. Often one facet of their musicianship outshines another. Not with Greg Fishman. Fishman shows he is equally adept at composing, performing and teaching the concepts included in these etudes. They are a MUST HAVE for any saxophonist, or student of the instrument. Run, do not walk to get all 5 books by Greg Fishman. --Skip Spratt, Sax Shed.com",JAZZ STUDIO

He gives the music life as he plays with abandon,  sings like a banshee, and takes his various bands wandering through Texas tunes, bluesy  crossovers, and even some modern surprises (check the rhythmic games they play on  ""Musical Five Special""). The charm of ""Shamrock Waltz"" and the 1949 version of ""Pine  Grove Blues"" are reason enough to own this collection.--Louis Gibson",

A couple is dancing cheek to cheek while  their favorite song is playing on the radio. Former lovers lock eyes across  a smoky room to the strains of a tinny piano. These common romantic images  show the important link between music and romance, a link that movie  producers have been aware of for a long time. Music is able to express the  ecstasy and despair of romance without having to awkwardly describe these  emotions in words. That is whyThe Romantic Approachis a unique  recording - it includes music written by some of America's finest composers  that expresses the full range of emotions felt while being in or merely  wanting to be in a romance.For example, Duke Ellington is a master at  conveying the first rush of heat felt when meeting the gaze of an  attractive person for the first time. His jazz-influencedVillage of the  Virginsis a very sophisticated and passionate piece. In contrast,  George Gershwin'sLullabyexpresses a more innocent attraction,  reminiscent of shy glances rather than bold stares.In many romances,  feelings of love are not returned or there are obstacles to be overcome.  John Cage'sDreamconveys all the longing of an unfulfilled romance.  The piece begins slowly, almost as if the musician is too weak to perform,  but at times accelerates in a flurry of notes as some memory comes rushing  back to the dreamer. Similarly, the solitary blare of the trumpet onQuiet Cityby Aaron Copland imparts a lonely quality to the piece.  This song will make you hold your lover close as you imagine a city full of  anonymous people looking for the relationship you and your lover  share.The feeling of being swept away is also a part of every good  romance, and Elliott Carter'sElegyis the perfect manifestation of  this experience. When listening to this beautiful work, great historical  romances such as that of King Edward VIII and Mrs. Simpson are called to  mind. The intense beauty and power of love are also excellently portrayed  in Samuel Barber'sAdagio. There is a sad element to this piece as  one remembers that romance is precarious and fragile.True to the  Romantic tradition, the music on this compilation centers on the sounds of  bowed strings. From the multi-tracked viola used in Cage's gentle and  hauntingDream, to the string quartet arrangement of Gershwin'sLullaby, to the massed string orchestra of Copland's evocativeQuiet City, the sonorities of bowed strings provide continuity  through the whole collection. These works and several others round out this  fascinating collection of American music that takes as its theme the  adventure of romance.",

A mix of live and studio recordings,Drinkin' in the Bluescontains both acoustic and electric music, as well as backup from such luminaries asBig Joe Williams,Sonny Terry, andBrownie McGhee. Hopkins had a gift for brilliant execution on the guitar, strong songwriting skills, and expressive vocals. He also had, as the opening track on this CD illustrates, impeccable comic timing; the monologues on ""Big Black Cadillac Blues"" must be ranked among this collection's finest moments. Given the quality of the music on this CD, that's high praise indeed.--Genevieve Williams",

Here,  in Three Sacred Hymns (1983), he takes the poetry of a 10th-century Armenian  monk and sets it to a more familiar Russian Orthodox format. This is an a  cappella piece written for Varley Polyansky himself. The Symphony 4 (1984) draws  musically on three main strands of Christianity--Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant- - while underneath there is a three-note semitone interval motif symbolizing  synagogue chant. It's a more meditative work than his other symphonies; it is  also one of his best.--Paul Cook",

The track selection for this mix reflects Pullen's production style; a nonstop barrage of tribal percussion provides the foundation for chords and melodies that build and release tension while constantly keeping the energy cranked up to 11. Stacey constructs the mix using three turntables, a rack of effects, and 24 top-quality techno records, creating transitions out of thin air and ensuring there's a surprise around every corner. And at the end, his own production talents are displayed on ""DJ Kicks (The Track),"" constructed exclusively for this compilation using samples from the mix itself.

The Fifth Quartet--widely considered to be one of the finest in the set--has three large movements, each almost exactly 10 minutes in length. It's a superbly balanced and eloquently argued piece of chamber music. These quartets really reward serious listening, and this excellent series allows you to take the plunge at a very modest price.--David Hurwitz",

The String Quartet, Dvor&#xE1;k's ninth, may  ramble a bit, but it's so lovely as to disarm any critical reservations, at least on my part. The unusual  Terzetto, for two violins and viola, gets played mostly at home chamber music sessions when the  cellist hasn't shown up yet. It's relatively terse for Dvor&#xE1;k, but still expansive and beautiful. The set  of Dvor&#xE1;k's Quartets by the Prague Quartet (Deutsche Grammophon 429 193-2) has been the  standard for decades, but I find these performances better played and recorded, as well as less  expensive.--Leslie Gerber",

Folk Songs is exactly what the title says--a collection of folk songs from around the world which gives Berberian the opportunity to demonstrate her ability to sing in different languages and styles.

But Barbara Westphal is a superb violist. She plays with tremendous energy and flair, and she gets the sound I love from a viola: woody, musky, like a great chanteuse. Ursula Oppens, who has been redirecting her career towards mainstream repertory, proves to be a great Brahms player. She also plays with great energy but never overwhelms her partner. Forget the play-time; this is a great recording.--Leslie Gerber",

In competition with septetos and tipicos playing the newer &quot;son,&quot; these danzoneras incorporated boleros, rhumbas, beguines, and more vocals into their repertoires and were very popular.

The essence of bygone Cuba courses through this historically interesting (e.g., legendary Cachao playing a youthful contrabass with Las Maravillas de Arcano) and evocative remembrance of a cosmopolitan and sophisticated Havana, where all but three of these tracks were recorded.--Derek Rath",

Tintner proves just as clear-headed and loving a Brucknerian from the vantagepoint of the podium. He takes the composer's tempo relationships on faith, letting the music run its natural course while never letting the momentum sag one drop. The orchestra breathes as well as sings together, although the splendid brass section tends to overpower the winds during loud tuttis.

If you don't insist on masterpieces all the time, this Concerto can be a lot of fun. Not so for the multinational suite, which is a group of rather feeble imitations of national styles.

Although he remade symphonies 5 through 7, these are his first versions, essentially the same performances that used to be available in three separate boxes at mid price. Now at budget price, and at virtually a third of the cost of DG's Bernstein set, Tennstedt's Mahler is one hell of a bargain. The performances aren't as consistent as Bernstein's. The London Philharmonic was never a great Mahler orchestra, and minor errors are fairly common, especially in the Sixth Symphony, which was the conductor's own favorite among all his recordings despite the lapses in the brass section. It's a performance of frightening intensity, and it's easy to understand his affection for it. All of Tennstedt's Mahler features such spontaneity, emotional honesty, and real human warmth that reservations about execution and sound largely fall by the wayside. Hearing it again is a deeply moving experience.--David Hurwitz",

He also apparently had no gift for memorable melody, a distinct liability in his chosen style. A few of these pieces stand out for their interesting touches, like the exotic opening dance from the operaThe Caliph.

Catchy tunes encourage kids to sing, play, and march along, while Palmer skillfully uses pitch, tempo, and rhythm to reinforce his lyrics. In ""Roller Coaster,"" for instance, tempo and pitch vary to conjure an image of a roller coaster slowly climbing a hill and then rushing down the other side. Palmer sounds comfortable using a wide variety of sounds (including a children's chorus, percussion, keyboards, strings, and woodwinds) in a number of styles (ballads, jitterbugs, and country, among others), which should delight most any child.Rhythms on Paradeis an easily accessible study of rhythm that will leave both parent and child humming long after the music stops.--Tami Horiuchi",Educational Activities

He's got a fine baritone voice, and the production on these cuts (some of which were originally intended for song pitching) is exactly what you'd want to hear.  So it's surprising that this is Haddock's first album!  Apparently he had some singles along the way, in a career which started in the 50's, and of course his songs were cut by others.  Big Night At My House is listed as a 1962 hit.  Haddock wrote 7 of these tunes, with Just Call Me Lonesome the most familiar cover.  With honky tonk music coming back so strong just lately (among the alternative country set I mean, some of us never got away from it) it would seem like this is a natural.   The tunes are somewhat more on the sentimental side of honky-tonk than the hard edged side, with the typical theme being a description of what folks are there for: drinkin', dancin' and lovin'. --BLUE SUEDE NEWS/#34 SPRINGThere may be no guarantees in life, but this might be as close as you're going to get.

The reality of the instrument is one of quiet strength. The traditional version of this bamboo flute is large, over a foot and a half long with a large outside circumference. It achieves its unique sound from the musician's ability to balance the force needed to fill such a tool with air and the control to make it not only melodious, but contemplative. Tajima Tadashi performs a series of solo songs, all from the meditative tradition, created not for performance or ritual, but as a tool for the musician to achieve a state of meditation and to challenge himself in his art.

Hickox's ability to balance the devotional with the dramatic is exceptional; contrapuntal lines are brought out with transparency, and the solo singing is uniformly fine. He nicely captures the tensions running through the Mass: its final D&nbsp;major resolution comes as a burst of bright sunlight. The substantial fillers date from early in Haydn's career.

Wool and her production partner, Daniel Weiss, have cabled together urban strands of anxiety, torpor, ambition, exhiliration, rapture slaking into rutted despair, and malaise.  What emerges is a song cycle seen through eyes viewing the post-modern world, and struggling to see it through the eyes of her significant other.  Devil You Dont carries the refrain I cant compete/with your idea of me and that theme artfully recurs throughout this exploration of how couples can be Playing both ends/Against the middle/But there is no middle/When the center wont hold.Wool sings so close to the emotional waterfall that she compels undivided attention.  Whether her nervy alto will go over the edge becomes the stuff of high drama.  Wools dedication to the song, as manifest in her years working on her craft at Jack Hardys weekly songwriting circles in Greenwich Village, coupled with Weiss studio expertise and musical skills, has resulted in a debut of such focused intimacy that it will stun listeners well into the coming millennium. --Mitch Ritter, Concord, CA",

Unfailingly charming in their melodic material, they skirt profundity but demonstrate admirable wit and joyful music-making. Emmanuel Pahud has made several recordings for EMI that have boosted him to the top rank of today's flute soloists, and this one will add to his growing luster. Still under 30, Pahud became principal flute of the Berlin Philharmonic at age 22, talking the seat once held by James Galway. He plays with a light, rounded tone and with the freedom of phrasing that finds interesting details where many others offer generalized boredom. His string partners take a back seat in this music, but they're unfailingly musical and hold their own in the music's interplay. A stylish, highly recommendable disc.--Dan Davis",

Alas, Silva's death changed those plans, bringing the Gonzales brothers together with tenor saxophonistDavid Sanchezto combine Silva's lyricalLester Young-influenced sound with Fort Apache's fiery Afro-Cuban jazz. The Tjader standbys ""Mongorama,"" ""Perfidia,"" ""Guajira at the Blackhawk,"" and ""Perdido"" are rendered in splendid clave-coded fashion.

The baritone-sax great put together the 13-man ensemble earlier in 1960, having set aside the quartet and sextet formats he'd explored with great success in the 1950s. Constructing the group around longtime foilBob Brookmeyer's trombone,Zoot Sims's fervent tenor, andMel Lewis's driving drums, the 33-year-old Mulligan came up with an ambitious, agile, and adept outfit that was forceful yet dexterous. Mixing originals with selections culled fromJohnny Mandel, Johnny Green,Ben Webster, andDuke Ellington, the bandleader's program showcases his cast more as a cohesive unit than as a forum for showy solos.--Steven Stolder",

Although the rather unexciting synth of ""White Rock II"" came out around the same time as this release, ""Preludes"" shows that Wakeman is still keeping his lushly Romantic piano chops in fine order. ""Preludes"" is certainly among his better piano efforts, and is much in the same vein as the ""Heritage Suite"" or, even closer still, the pensive work on his ""Airs"" trilogy. It helps, too, that Wakeman got off the Isle of Man to record this one; the engineering is a clear improvement over many other efforts from the last decade. The lovely lilting opening track, ""Prelude to a Millenium,"" and the brittle ascending scales of ""Reflections of a Winter's Day"" alone should guarantee this album a permanent place in the Wakeman canon. ~ Paul Collins, All Music Guide",

This was actually one of the major arguments of the punk wave during the second half of the Seventies that had set as a goal (If they ever had one.) to get rid of the ""Dinosaurs"" that YES, GENESIS, EMERSON, LAKE & PALMER and others had become. It would be completely dishonest to deny this superficial and over simplifying reasoning a small hint of truth, but SEBASTIAN HARDIE could be a good example of the contrary. At about the same time, four anonymous people from down under tried to show that our favourite style can go very well with a lyrical, melodical and accessible music. Recorded in 1975, ""Four Moments"" is like a whole, if not conceptual, at least musical. This is a marvellous symphonic Progressive rock opus that shows very elaborate themes that have a",

There was more than a little of it mixed into Cray'sTake Your Shoes Off; likewise, withCome to Papa--a soul-sounding title if ever there was one--Weathersby sexes it up with incredibly smooth vocals and soaring guitar lines. While there's a strong element of Chicago in Weathersby's sound, there's just as much soul, especially on slower numbers like the sultry ""Walking the Back Streets and Cryin',"" or his extremely mellow take on theCharles Brownclassic ""Drifting Blues,"" which closes the album. As befits such soulful blues,Come to Papafeatures a strong, tight horn section on the funkier numbers, such as the title track, with guest vocals fromAnn Peebles, and ""(I Feel Like) Breakin' Up Somebody's Home."" This is, overall, a solid effort with excellent songwriting, although memorable moments--like the guitar solo on ""A Good Man Is Hard to Find""--are few.

But after her childhood career, which did not include any recordings, she withdrew from performing and later published an autobiography detailing the hellish life her father had imposed on her. Slenczynska returned to public performance in the early 1950s, but she has never had a major career as an adult and has made only a few LPs. Ivory Classics has taken an interest in Slenczynska, reissuing a disc of uneven performances from early mono LPs (70802) and a superb live concert from the 1980s (70902). This is her first studio recording in decades, made in 1999. Although her technique is never in doubt, Slenczynska slights the virtuosic elements ofCarnavalsomewhat, making hers a performance mostly for introverts. In the more consistently lyrical music ofKinderszenen, though, she is rivetingly intense and very moving. She reads some rhythms in the opening movement of the Sonata rather oddly, but otherwise gives us a splendid performance, full of drama. The best elements of this disc make it well worth hearing.--Leslie Gerber",

When he molds a phrase or sets a tempo, you feel there's no other way to play it. Contributing to that sense of rightness is his refusal to go over the top, so the opening movement of the ""Waldstein"" never spills over into overt aggressiveness, and the quicksilver mood shifts of the ""Tempest"" always seem to come from the music's inner logic, rather than being imposed by a showoff virtuoso. Beethoven set off the drama in the ""Tempest"" with his next work in the Op. 31 set, Sonata No. 18. Solomon clearly differentiates between the two, giving the latter a kinder, gentler touch. The little, two-movement 22nd Sonata lends itself to virtuosic heroics, and here we get an unbuttoned Solomon, who rips through it with abandon.--Dan Davis",

Perhaps the most startlingly original items here were conceived for wind band, namely the bracingly tangyHill Song No.2and that ambitious, extraordinarily titled essayThe Power of Rome and the Christian Heart(which also draws on material from the first movement of Grainger's gloriousDanish Folk Song Suite).

ProducerT Bone Burnettenlists the voices ofAlison Krauss,Gillian Welch,Emmylou Harris,Ralph Stanley, and kindred spirits for performances of traditional material, in arrangements that are either a cappella or feature bare-bones accompaniment.

A two-disc set, consisting of 14 suites for harpsichord, taken from a variety of sources (two from the 1649 manuscript and one from that of 1656), and all owing their provenance to the Strasbourg manuscript of 1675, transcribed by the Slovak Michael Bulyowsky. This recently discovered document clinches Froberger's place &#x96; as a synthesizing composer, working in German-speaking Europe &#x96; and harnessing the formalities of the Teutonic, with the elaborations of the Italianate and the lilting freedoms of the French, with more than a nod to Frescobaldi and Couperin. Froberger is a cameo Telemann, but with none of the worldly energy and entrepreneurial skills of the latter. With only one hexachord fantasia published during his lifetime, Froberger had no interest in the publication of his works, concerned more with the way they were performed than about their dissemination.Ludger R&#xE9;my is a careful researcher, as well as a poised interpreter, and his account of Froberger's music accedes to both these categories. The courantes are fluid and lilting, with an easy in&#xE9;gal, the gigues (placed by Froberger mostly in second position in the suites) with a Scarlatti-like elegance (Suite No. 9 in D), the sarabandes with a sombre resonance (Suite No. 10 in E minor) and the allemandes, which open most of the suites, presented as courtly overtures. Suite No. 5 in G minor, the &#x91;Allemande faite al'honneur de Madame Sybille Duchesse de Wirtemberg', heralds a grande entrance for the music, hinting at a scarcely contained theatricality which presages the end of the century's immersion in the dramatic music of Lully and Rameau. This suite demonstrates in miniature Froberger's range and variety, and allows R&#xE9;my to explore his own disciplined range: a running in&#xE9;gal Courante gives way to an extravagant, spreading Sarabande to match the suite's grand opening.In an earlier Sarabande (Suite No. 2 in D minor) Froberger's evocative music strains wordlessly towards the possibility of another kind of drama. The style bris&#xE9;, derived from lute techniques, leads into an aria-like strain which cries out for words. R&#xE9;my adds subtle ornaments on the repeats, still leaving the original music to sing for itself.R&#xE9;my's care with the music shows respect, perhaps, rather than bubbling enthusiasm, and this, of course, is a comment on his interpretative approach rather than a criticism. Now and again he is drawn into something beyond the merely loving &#x96; in Suite No. 8 in G, the opening Allemande takes him through an extended in&#xE9;gal into a slow, downwardly plummeting scale, building the harmony a single note at a time. His touch is just right, his contemplative mood retaining the drive towards the overlapping phrases and cadences. The Strasbourg Manuscript, incidentally, is currently being prepared for publication.Michelene Wandor  --From International Record Review - subscribe now",

B000050432,London Symphonies 2,16.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61RLgz45fpL._SY300_.jpg,{'Music': 285110},"[['CDs & Vinyl', 'Classical', 'Symphonies'], ['Musical Instruments', 'Instrument Accessories', 'General Accessories']]","It's surely no coincidence that Haydn's nicknamed symphonies are the most regularly played and recorded. Haydn the showman delighted in playing tricks on his audience, nowhere more so than in the ""Clock"" and the ""Surprise"" symphonies. But beyond the charming gimmicks, these works are masterpieces of form and melody and, along with Mozart's later symphonies, represent the apogee of the Classical symphony before Beethoven and the stormy Romantics began rocking the boat. The ticking motif of the ""Clock"" seems to encapsulate the rational Age of Enlightenment; the unexpected crescendos of the ""Surprise"" affectionately mock it. The third work on this disc, Symphony No. 102, lacks both a nickname and a gimmick, but all three share a sublime slow movement flanked by outer movements of great vivacity and life-affirming joy. This second volume of ""London"" symphonies from Richard Hickox and his period-instrument band, Collegium Musicum 90, displays the same estimable qualities as thethe first: a sure grasp of nuance, crisp tempos, and, above all, marvelously unfussy readings. Here, the emphasis is simply on Haydn's music, and neither conductor nor orchestra indulges in anything to draw undue attention to themselves. Take the surprise in the ""Surprise"" symphony, for example, which is neither underplayed nor overdramatic. Or the brisk opening ""Presto"" of the ""Clock,"" whose inherent joyfulness is projected entirely without affectation. Impeccable Chandos engineering guarantees that these much-loved, oft-recorded works have rarely sounded fresher.--Mark Walker",

These patterns are then recontextualized and layered with melody to produce a subtle form of electro-acoustic music -- and yet despite all that, it1s pop music at heart.",

Written in 1913, it has a freshness of invention that is irresistible. Perhaps the text (an adaptation of anEdgar Allan Poe poem) struck a chord with this composer's sensibilities: different bells symbolize different facets of existence. The piece deserves more frequent airing, and it is to be hoped that Mikhail Pletnev and his Russian forces help raise awareness of it. The soloists are superb (Mescheriakova is particularly impressive), but the real star is the Moscow State Chamber Choir. This is a worthy companion to Pletnev's accounts ofRachmaninov orchestral works. Also included is a piece by Sergei Taneyev, a composer who should be more widely appreciated. Too often castigated in the textbooks for being overly academic, his works nevertheless demonstrate a creative originality that has immediate appeal. The cantataJohn of Damascusis something of a find. The Russian National Orchestra creates a superbly chilly atmosphere in the first movement, and once again the choir triumphs with fervent singing that conveys belief in the quality of this music.The Bellsranks as a fine modern performance, but the Taneyev might prove even more fascinating.--Colin Clarke",

Financially ruinous, because CPO is leading the JCB renaissance with a hard-to-resist complete orchestral works series of over 20 discs. Bad news, Nick &#x96; now it's starting on the vocal works. Called 'Salve regina', this revealing new disc takes us back to Christian's early Italian period (1754-62). All three pieces are recorded here for the first time and testify to the composer's pragmatic conversion to the Catholic faith and his ability to transfer the extravagant vocal style of the opera house (where he was principally engaged) to the church. What would his father have said? The vocal duties here are fairly evenly shared between Emma Kirkby, who sings the Salve regina, and tenor Markus Sch&#xE4;fer, who takes the exuberant motet Si nocte tenebrosa; they share the limelight in the almost frivolous setting of Psalm 113, Laudate pueri Dominum. Kirkby is supremely secure in the high-wire acrobatics required in the Salve regina: there's a superbly controlled 11-second messa di voce at the very outset and she manages to make real music out of the outrageous vocal contortions demanded by the aria 'Ad te clamamus'. If she exudes exemplary clarity and purity, Sch&#xE4;fer, with more rawness of tone and pitch, excels in precisely the kind of on-the-edge excitement which makes the fast and furious virtuoso showcase Si nocte tenebrosa the highlight of the disc. The only minor drawback is the rather characterless recording acoustic where everyone is quite closely miked in what sounds like a small studio. Even so, the music's effervescent early-Classical charm remains sharp. Johann Christian Bach's sacred vocal music has up to now been pretty much a closed book &#x96; if we are to judge from this disc, it looks as if the pickings will be rich indeed.Simon Heighes--From International Record Review - subscribe now",

Such a mellifluous instrumental combination could only inspire Spohr's melodic fluency and gift for felicitous textures. You can't help but delight in the B-flat Major Sonata's bubbly Rondo, in which the violin's lyrical lines are gently engulfed by the harp's rippling commentaries. Listen, for instance, to the exquisite give and take as the harp and violin trade motifs throughout the large-scaled D Major Sonata Concertante. Each of the C Minor sonata's two movements begins with an introduction that gives little indication of what's to emerge. The first movement intro, in fact, evokes more than just the spirit of Beethoven'sPath&eacute;tiquepiano sonata in the same key. By contrast, the decorative passages in the E Minor Trio for Violin, Cello, and Harp foreshadow Chopin's bel-canto-influenced language. The basic sweetness of Sophie Langdon's well-focused tone is tinged with an attractive acerbic edge, not unlike a pinch of salt in the tequila. Susan Dorey's inflected phrasing helps move the Trio forward, and harpist Hugh Webb's effortless, feathery technique is all one can wish for in this irresistible music. With Naxos's crystalline sonics, thorough program notes, and enticing price, how can you possibly go wrong? Bring on volume 2, please!--Jed Distler",

It's full of humor, attractive melodies, inventive instrumental and chamber effects, and variants of his marches, peasant dances, and cowbell pastorales, along with thrilling huge climaxes. Michael Tilson Thomas made afine versionand, of course, Bernstein'sNew York Philharmonic recordingis a longstanding favorite. Now Gielen, in the midst of an outstanding Mahler cycle for Hanssler, joins the elite Mahler 7ths with this brilliantly played, well-detailed recording. He has a command of Mahler's large-scale structures along with a way of bringing telling touches to your attention, as in the slapped pizzicato basses in the Scherzo. He also isn't afraid to lean into those typical arching string melodies that lose impact unless played with the rubato effects Gielen applies. And he makes sense of the wild final movement, a riot of conflicting themes and instrumental effects that sometimes sounds like a Charles Ives piece indulging on Viennese strudel. Mahler buffs shouldn't miss this one.--Dan Davis",

The latter spawned the infectious Canadian Top 20 single Come for a Ride, which received massive play on modern and mainstream rock stations, and the video was in serious high rotation on Much Music... not bad for a bunch of earthy slackers. Good Morning Beautiful is a love letter to the universe, a crazy voyage of melody and charm, harmony and cacophony.  The album took 14 months to make, each track a finely crafted and catchy song; something fans have come to expect from By Divine Right.  From the ""dream one-song parade"" of Hugger of Trees and the Lou Reed/Motown influenced Sweet Lovin&#x92; to the scrappy Medicine and Supernatural, Good Morning Beautiful is their most luminous and visionary achievement, transcending genres, and yet embodying the highest spirit and elation of rock and roll music.

Here, he counters the accepted Mozart-lite style, projecting these works on a broad Romantic canvas. He opens the C Minor Concerto with an immensely powerful orchestral introduction, perfectly balanced, revelatory in exposing details, and with climaxes like hammer blows. When the violins enter with their sharply accented figure, they stand out like shrieks in the night--startling at first, but appropriate to this tragic work even as it defies period style. His piano entrance is soft and dreamy. His dialogue with orchestra anticipates the slow movement of Beethoven's Fourth Concerto, and his very slow Larghetto features sighing strings and immaculately played wind solos and duets. Anderszewski's cadenzas in both concertos are boldly original, the playing throughout full of feeling and tonal beauty. The sunnier C Major gets more conventional treatment, still replete with individual touches that make his reading stand out from the crowd. Perahia and Brendel may be safer bets, but Anderszewski is exciting and unpredictable. Vivid engineering is an important plus.--Dan Davis",

At the beginning of his career, as in the Six Piano Pieces, he wrote a reasonable facsimile of his teacher's music. The first of these pieces, ""Love Song,"" is the best known of the set, but it's not the only beautiful one. ""Moods,"" even less familiar music, is similarly lovely. By the time he wroteAbout Mother, Suk had been through the experience that was to transform his life: the early death of his greatly beloved wife, Otilie. (Suk's grief was so great he never remarried.) The tenderness and vivid expressive quality ofAbout Mothermakes it one of the most memorable piano works of the entire Romantic era. Fortunately, the Finnish pianist Risto Lauriala is completely in touch with Suk's idiom, playing with the relaxed lyricism and lush tone the music requires. All this music is worthwhile, but hearingAbout Motherin quiet solitude is the kind of experience recordings were invented for.--Leslie Gerber",

Sharon Kam has proved in concert performances of classical music that she is a virtuoso with a strong musical personality. Here, she proves that, in addition to having complete mastery of her instrument and all its resources, she also has an uncanny ability to identify with the styles and idioms of her adopted country. Only in Gershwin's ""Summertime"" do the jazzy inflections and liberties sound artificial; otherwise, she produces just the right kind of vibrato, sliding, rhythmic flexibility, and expression. Her tone is full of variety and beautiful over a huge range; even at the top--and she goes up to a high B-flat--it does not sound shrill; her facility and security are fabulous. Copland's Concerto, written forBenny Goodman, is very tonal, chordal, and simple, though the second part is brilliant and rather dissonant. In the first of Bernstein's three pieces, the solo melts into the band; the others are perhaps the wildest, most raucous music on the program. Morton Gould's ""Derivations"" come as a relief: mild, pleasant, and singing, they let the soloist engage in conversation with members of the band, and finally become more driving.Artie Shawclearly wrote his Concerto for himself, and Kam plays it to the hilt for technical and tonal virtuosity. The arrangements of Gershwin's famous songs demonstrate the vocal quality of the clarinet. The orchestra, from which the various band combinations are extracted, matches Kam's style admirably.--Edith Eisler",

These seven great, beloved waltzes are like a cornucopia of golden melodies; performed by musicians to whom the style is as natural as their native dialect, each seems more beautiful than the last. Boskovsky, founder of the Vienna Octet and Philharmonic Quartet, was concertmaster of the Vienna Philharmonic from 1939 to 1971 and took over the Johann Strauss Orchestra in 1969. His way with these waltzes is probably as ""authentic"" as one is likely to find. Those lilting rhythms sway and bounce, making the music dance right off the disc. However, compared to that of many other conductors, his approach is surprisingly straightforward. Though he takes time for elegant, poised transitions, the momentum is always maintained; only the introductions are free, flexible, and ruminative. He brings out the contrasts of mood, dynamics, and character, but the expressiveness never degenerates into sentimentality or exaggeration. The orchestra is very good; its sound is full but rather brassy, sometimes resembling a military band. Indeed, the instrumentation for these waltzes raises questions. It is thought that they were originally performed by a solo violinist (the composer), two violins, viola, and bass. Later, winds, piano and harmonium were added, and eventually they were scored for full orchestra. For an interesting comparison, listen to two other version: Alexander Schneider's, which duplicates the original five-piece group, but sounds a bit rough, and theAlban Berg Quartet's, with arrangements by Alexander Weinmann for two violins, viola and bass, and by Schoenberg, Berg and Webern for a group including bass, flute, clarinet, harmonium, and piano.  The playing on the latter is fabulous: lilting, idiomatic, joyful, and intoxicating in sound. --Edith Eisler",

Yet she never seems in danger of disappearing in one of the crater-sized footprints left behind by those giants, nor does she seem interested in competing with the kind of performances they gave. For all of its freshness, verve and conceptual freedom, this performance of Brahms&#x92;s Opus 25 is not as joyously extroverted as Rubinstein&#x92;s 1932 version with members of the Pro Arte Quartet (BMG Classics), as thunderously exciting as Gilels' 1948 recording with members of the Beethoven Quartet (Doremi) or as intellectually probing as Serkin's 1949 account with members of the Busch Quartet (EMI). The goals of Argerich, Kremer, Bashmet, and Maisky seem closer to those Schoenberg mentioned in 1937, just after he completed his famous orchestral transcription of the Piano Quartet In G minor: ""It is always played very badly, because the pianist plays louder the better he is, and you hear nothing of the strings,"" Schoenberg said. ""I wanted to hear it all for once, and that's what I&#x92;ve achieved."" Argerich and her trio of superstar Russian string players achieve it, too, even in the devil-may-care-abandon of the finale--a breathless, relentlessly pounding movement in gypsy style. What Schoenberg accomplishes with an orchestra that includes trombones, xylophone, and glockenspiel, Argerich matches with her mastery of touch and pedaling. She produces a wickedly seductive and penetrating cimbalom-like timbre that allows her to dominate the movement without swamping the other players. Despite its late opus number, Schumann's rarely performed Fantasiestuecke is the composer's first attempt at the piano trio genre. Argerich, Kremer, and Maisky perform it with taste and virtuosity.--Stephen Wigler",

Heady stuff that probably accounts for its rarity&#x96; this is the first recording of the complete opera. Like its predecessor,Die Harmonie der Weltbest known through the symphony Hindemith based on it. But it&#x92;s an engrossing opera full of quality music and deserves to be ranked among the composer&#x92;s masterpieces. It doesn&#x92;t lack for dramatic situations, including grave plunderings, confrontations with the high and mighty of the Renaissance like Wallerstein and Rudolf II, and the personal and intellectual strivings of its hero, the astronomer Johannes Kepler. The action travels from Prague to key central European cities, covering a time span from 1608 to 1630. And there&#x92;s an abundance of melody, dramatic fireworks, and lyric passages to make up for the lack of popular arias.Fortunately,Die Harmonie der Weltgets a fine performance from Marek Janowski and his cast. Francois Le Roux is excellent as Kepler, singing and acting with authority, and subsidiary roles are well done and often better than that. The only flaw here is the casting of Susanna, the soprano lead and love interest with a singer who is, to be blunt, downright awful. But in the overall scheme of a 2-hour-and-40-minute opera, she inflicts minimal damage. Opera buffs, especially those attracted to accessible tonal modern operas, will want this important recording. They can be secure in the belief that it gets a worthy performance and is not likely to be rivaled for a long time to come.--Dan Davis",

But the other six tracks all come from King's third solo album, 1971's Music, and they sound like they've been mastered from someone's third-generation cassette copy of an old LP, with poor sound and distortion.

Valentino, the charismatic singer who led both the Beau Brummels to 1960's pop stardom and later, the 1970's FM underground gypsy-hippie band, Stoneground, has only gained in style and substance.  His soaring vocals and commanding stage presence onEverything is Broken,Please Crawl Out Your Window, and the show-stoppingIsis, were the first new efforts from Valentino in twenty-five years!  In keeping with Dylan's storied history, a second tribute night was quickly scheduled for January 2003 - this time, electric! Greene's rhythm section backed all players, with Greene backing also on guitar, harmonica, bass and piano.

Vieuxtemps (1820-1881) was not only one of the greatest violinists of his time but also a master pedagogue who taught or influenced Ysa&#xFF;e, Hubay, and Auer. His compositions are generally regarded as mere bravura showpieces, but this is contradicted by these last three concertos, which--though they do indeed demand utmost virtuosity from the player--reveal solid structural craftsmanship, masterful orchestration, and considerable emotional depth and intensity. No. 5 is the most familiar, but all abound in lovely melodies, inventive harmonies, and almost operatic drama and lyricism. As in the previous two volumes (Concertos Nos. 1 and 4andConcertos Nos. 2 and 3), the playing is spectacular. Keylin!  has the effortless brilliance, facility and flair to make the most hair-raising technical feats seem easy; he tosses off long passages in staccato, harmonics, and double and triple stops; his runs are perfectly clear at any speed. His tone is pure, focused, and beautiful, glowing in the low register, soaring up high, and he can change mood, color, and expression instantly with bow and vibrato. In the early concertos, he gave shape to the often overabundant sequences, keeping the grandeur from becoming bombastic and the fireworks from sounding empty. Here, without external effects, sentimentality, or excess, he projects every emotional nuance with captivating charm and genuine identification, from pensive inwardness to passionate ardor. For lovers of the best violin virtuoso writing and playing, this record is a must.--Edith Eisler",

Chris Proctor tackles a wide range of ideas and techniques, taking this richly toned instrument into new and undiscovered territory.This course is jam-packed with invaluable information, including important tips on tuning, stringing and setting up the 12-string for maximum output and intonation. You&#x92;ll learn the open G and C tunings pioneered and widely used by Leo Kottke and other leading 12-string stylists, and the way Chris tunes down a step to get more resonance and depth from his instrument.Most 12-string players strike the octave and unison pairs of strings simultaneously. Chris shows you a revolutionary way of picking the twelve strings individually, using alternate thumb and finger picking within the pairs of strings. Fiddle tunes such as ""Sailor&#x92;s Hornpipe"" and ""Fisher&#x92;s Hornpipe"" can be played with flowing melodies and resonant, ringing tones using a minimum of left hand movement.Chris covers many other important skills, including use of the bottleneck slide, fingerpicks, string mute, harmonics (especially lush on the 12-string guitar), and other techniques that will help you to play powerful and evocative instrumentals. You&#x92;ll learn, in detail, ""Halfway,"" ""Bells of the Harbor,"" ""War Games"" and ""Over the Pass.""

The requests for copies of the song from others who heard it exploded and have literally come in from all over the country and even foreign countries.  With the encouragement of many, Burke finally consented to recording some other songs he had written.  One track on the CD ""The best is yet to come"" was sent to an international company and accepted as their theme song in their March 2003 convention.  Burke was invited to preform in the Tokyo Dome in Tokyo, Japan to more than 30,000 people!  Burke sold 3,000 CDs there and was very well received.  The title track ""Let it all come down"" has found great popularity because of it's strong relation to recent world events and sentiment.While all background vocals were recorded by Burke himself, the musicians used in recording and arranging are a star-studded cast of top talent in the industry.

Halls tend to be large rooms with lots of reflective surfaces, where sounds can swim around, changing timbre over time. This is a classic reverb that sounds good on just about anything. Try it on vocals, drums, acoustic, electric, or orchestral instruments.Hall 1:A large bright hall program--works well for almost anything, try it on drums, guitars or vocals.Hall 2:A warmer hall program--especially adds depth and character to acoustic guitars and pianos with it's decay set long.Hall 3:A medium hall with 12ms of predelay before the reverb starts. It sounds great on big rock snares, but try it on vocals and electric guitar, too.Real Room (3 Programs)This algorithm gives you the sound of a medium size studio room. This algorithm uses a lot of processing power for a rich sound and smooth decay. It has a punchier, bigger sound than a hall reverb, which makes it good for rock and dance music. The attack is also more reflective. It sounds good on drums, keyboards and guitars.Room 1:A hardwood studio room with a lot of early reflection slap for big drum sounds; also works well for acoustic instruments, especially with the decay turned up.Room 2:Perfect for adding a little ambiance to a dry track. Try it on antiseptic synth sounds or on dry, unplugged mixes with the decay set short.Room 3:Ideal for acoustic guitars and classical instruments, this program emulates a warmer studio room.Plate Reverb (3 Programs)This is a simulation of a classic echo plate, a 4' by 8' suspended sheet of metal with transducers at either end used to produce reverb. Popular in the 1970's, it is still prized for its transparent sound, particularly on vocals and guitars. It works well for a lush lead vocal, piano, or guitar, especially when looking for a classic rock and roll sound.Plate 1:A classic bright vocal plate for pristine lead and background vocals.Plate 2:A warmer variation of the previous program, great for adding sustain on acoustic guitar and strings.Plate 3:A more realistic simulation of a vintage tube plate reverb. It has very little bottom end, which makes it great for snappy snares and skinny guitars.Nonlinear (1 Program)In the mid '80s, a certain British producer/engineer (who shall remain anonymous) discovered a clever way of creating a huge drum sound. He would place the drum set in a large, reverberant room, mic the room and chop off the end of the reverb tail with a noise gate. When this sound caught on, digital reverbs began to be released with a ""Nonlinear"" program, which simulated this effect. In the end their simulation became more widely used than the effect it was trying to emulate, and the non linear reverb earned it's place in effects history.Nonlinear:A classic example of the mid-80's ""Nonlin"" gate program, most commonly used on snares and toms, but can also spice up brass stabs and percussion.Reverb Parameter Adjust -- DecayThe reverb decay determines how long the reverb will sound before it dies away. Turning up the reverb decay will have the effect of increasing the room's size. Generally, classical, jazz, and ballad styles will use longer decay times than uptempo rock or dance music.Pitch Based Effects (5 Programs)Pitch based effects alter the pitch and delay of a signal in various ways to produce ""layered"" timbres that are more complex than the original signal. Some of these effects are achieved by splitting the signal into at least two parts, effecting the pitch of one of the parts, then mixing them back together. This eventual mixing is essential since the overall sound of the effect is achieved by the difference between the dry, uneffected signal and the effects signal.Chorus:Achieved by splitting the signal into four parts with a dry signal and a separate detuning section for both left and right channels. The detuning is further effected by being modulated by an LFO (low frequency oscillator), which causes the detuning to vary. The NanoVerb's chorus has individual LFOs controlling the left and right sides, set at different rates. This effect, called true stereo chorus, often has a wider stereo image than regular stereo chorus effects.Flange:First used in the 1960s, ""flanging"" was achieved by the use of two tape recorders that would record and play back the same program in synchronization. By slowing down one tape machine, and then letting it catch up with the other, different phase cancellations would occur at different frequencies.Rotary:The Rotary effect emulates a rotating speaker. This effect was extremely popular during the 1960s and was achieved by mechanically rotating the speakers to produce complex timbral changes. The lezlie speaker system is most often used with tone-wheel organs, but is occasionally used for guitar amplification as well. When changing the speed between fast and slow, the effect will slowly ramp to the new speed rather than change abruptly, just as the original would do.Chorus/Room 1:A layered true stereo chorus and large room reverb. It works great on guitars, synths and electric pianos.Chorus/Room 2:Adds a delay to the chorus/room sound for a different flavor. It works well for slow, funky guitars or big ballad solos.Delay (1 Program)Delay is a discrete echo repeat, unlike the rapid wash of repeats that create reverb effects. It is useful for adding depth to a track or performance if reverb is adding too much coloration to the sound.Delay:This program provides a delay of up to 1270 ms. The delay time can be adjusted in 10 millisecond increments.

In addition, you will also find a Deep control, which adds a resonant bass boost, giving you a similar feel and response to the resonant thump of Marshall 4x12 cabinet.

The recording's guest list is rather impressive, from an indie standpoint at least. Shoving off with no less an eccentric talent than the inimitable Robert Wyatt, Sixteen Haiku drifts soundtrack-like through 22 unnamed pieces (&#34;Haiku Five,&#34; &#34;Haiku Six,&#34; etc.) According to Boyatzis' liner notes, the guests involved recorded their respective vocal interpretations over Sigmatropic's existing tracks; the resulting musical threads tie together what might otherwise be a mess of tangled voices. The album percolates with electronic programming, and the grooves of what might be labeled indie electronica. Processed bits of guitar build subtle melodies over thick bass, wildly varied drum loops, faraway snatches, traditional instrumentation, and assorted blips of human laughter and muttering. Ultimately, however, Sixteen Haiku and Other Stories is about words and voices. Wyatt, Laetitia Sadier, Alejandro Escovedo, and Edith Frost dress their performances in personal nuance, but never outpace the poetry itself. (The artfully simplistic couplets are included in the accompanying booklet, along with a brief Seferis bio.) &#34;I am raising now/A dead butterfly/With no make-up,&#34; Cat Power sings in &#34;Haiku 10.&#34; It's brief at just over a minute. But the track's atmospheric buzz is sold by Chan Marshall's particular phrasing. This holds true throughout the album. Despite all the distinct personalities and their clever interpretations, no one piece ever really stands out. Instead, they each pour a spoonful of sparkling crystals into Sixteen Haiku and Other Stories' rejuvenating mineral spring. --All Music GuideRelying on a cheap pun isn't normally the best way to start a review. But given Sigmatropic's origins, as well as its strange mix of sounds, the oft-quoted expression &#34;it's all Greek to me&#34; somehow seems appropriate.Taken literally, Sigmatropic refers to Greek producer/multi-instrumentalist Akis Boyatzis, who recruited several musicians to create this inspired interpretation of 16 poems by the late Greek Nobel laureate George Seferis. The saying, however, might also apply to the collective's esoteric approach, which often makes the music difficult to grasp. The otherworldly arrangements -- forged through a combination of guitars, violin, glockenspiel, cello, Celtic harp, synths and keyboards -- create a kind of cosmic brew, sometimes churning, mostly free-floating. The results accentuate the reflective qualities of Seferis' meditations, from the ethereal sounds that drift through the various haiku to the swirling melodic cacophony that ignites &#34;The Dead Sea&#34; and &#34;Water Warm.&#34;Fortunately, the overall sense of disorientation is cushioned by an array of guest singers, including such luminaries as Cat Power, Robert Wyatt, Alejandro Escovedo, Mark Eitzel, Howe Gelb, Lee Ranaldo, Laetitia Sadier of Stereolab, and Carla Torgerson of the Walkabouts. They gently intone Seferis' words, as translated into English, making the project a bit more palatable to American ears. Softly sensual, these tone poems effectively celebrate their muse through the music. --Phoenix New Times",

In the early to mid 1980's, the Vater brothers began producing private-label drumsticks alongside sticks for Vic Firth and Zildjian. A few years of this led to the brothers deciding to move their business to a new factory in Holbrook MA.

Other technologies licensed by BBE Sound into the consumer electronics market either incorporate this core technology or are optimized for best results when used with BBE High Definition Sound.Because the BBE Sonic Maximizer range of professional audio processors is so popular among music and sound professionals we first highlight the benefits of BBE High Definition Sound in terms of useage by musicians and sound professionals:Natural Musical Realism - music has great ""live presence"". Unlike some ""exciter"" devices which add fatiguing artificial harmonics to the signal, BBE adds nothing artificial to the signal but instead restructures it to faithfully allow all the detail and nuance to be heard.Full Frequency Operation - Highs frequencies are clearer, naturally brilliant and more finely detailed. Lows are tight, well defined and harmonically rich. All from a single processor with easy two-knob adjustment of the BBE process.Speech intelligibility - Sound contractors know that vocal intelligibility is paramount to a successful PA installation and client satisfaction. No other audio processor brings natural clarity and crisp definition to the spoken word like BBE does. That's why BBE Sonic Maximizer processors can be found installed in PA systems ranging from the massive network in New York's JFK airport to the thousands of houses of worship around the world.Electric and acoustic guitars - have sparkle, clarity and definition. BBE sound processing brings out the harmonic complexity and bite significantly increases cutting power. Each note of a chord becomes more distinct. Brings guitars out of the ""mud"".Keyboards and synthesizers - take on new realism. Percussive and plucked sounds are clear and sharp, chords are rich and full-textured, each note in the chord retains its integrity.Electric & acoustic basses - take on that rich, earthy ""CD"" sound. Five string players love what it does to the ""B"" string. Extremely tight, punchy bottom end with all the presence, clarity and bite of the top end.Vocals - cut through the amplified instrument so you can be heard better. Lyrics of the sound are no longer ""buried in the mix"".Improves effect processing - expands the spatial dimension of stereo reverb and chorus. Whether in an individual instrument rack or across a full mix, BBE makes a dramatic improvement in the quality of effects and neutralizes their tendency to muffle instrument and vocal characteristics.Recording studios, home and professional - use BBE on individual tracks, mixdown, and of course in mastering, BBE brings out the full spectrum of sound. Mixes with BBE are fresh and sparkly. BBE gives you enough sparkle to restore instrument clarity or increase vocal intelligibility without appreciably adding level.Broadcast clarity - broadcast facilities all over the the world depend on BBE for the best possible transmission quality. From huge operations such as Japan's NHK to local music stations such as Los Angeles' 94.7 The Wave, BBE has become a necessity for modern quality broadcast quality.Transients and Harmonics: The Color Codes of SoundTo understand how BBE sound processing technology works, consider the characteristics of a loudspeaker and what we expect from one. Among a loudspeaker's most important requirements is the ability to reproduce transients - the brief high-energy bursts at the beginning of sounds. The transients then evolve into harmonics. It is the particular amplitudes and phase relationships of these transients and harmonics which add the unique color and character to each sound.Varying either the amplitude or the phase of the transients and harmonics within signal causes distortion of the sound's characteristics. By drastically altering the transient response of a sound, it's possible to make a cymbal crash seem like a car crash. Similarly, altering amplitude or phase relationships of the harmonics in a clarinet's tone can make it sound more like a flute, or a French horn like an oboe.Amplitude and PhaseA loudspeaker's transient response is typically expressed in terms of amplitude response (how quickly it reacts to an incoming signal), with little or no regard to phase response (whether high and low frequencies are reproduced at the proper time). The ability to accurately represent a sound's phase and amplitude define the quality of a loudspeaker's transient and steady - state, or sustained, response.If a loudspeaker's amplitude response curve were linear, then the relationship between the high and low frequencies would be correct. And if a loudspeaker's phase response curve were linear, then the low and high frequencies would reach the listener's ears in their correct time order. This would result in faithful reproduction of the sound. However, this isn't normally the case.Why is Live Sound so Pleasing?When we listen to live music, all of the highs and lows reach our ears in the same relationship to each other as when they were created by the instruments. If this same live music were to be recorded and played back through a loudspeaker system, the loudspeaker would introduce frequency-dependent phase shifting. The inductance of the speaker's voice coil creates a stronger impedance as the signal's frequency increases, resulting in a time delay. Consequently, frequency components with large negative phase shifts (high frequencies) arrive at the listener's ear later than signals undergoing small phase shifts (low frequencies). The resultant signal is distorted in the time domain to the listener's ear. Audio material containing sharp transients (e.g., percussive and plucked sounds such as drums, guitar, piano and harpsichord, etc.) suffers the most from this phenomenon, making it seem unfocused, or mushy.In order to address these problems inherent in basic loudspeaker design, BBE Sound, Inc. has developed a circuit that has two primary functions. The first adjusts the phase relationships of the low, mid and high frequencies. Since a loudspeaker's natural tendency is to add progressively longer delay times to higher frequencies, the BBE sound processing system adds progressively longer delay times to lower frequencies. This creates a kind of ""mirror"" curve to the time delay curve created by the speaker, neutralizing its phase distortion.The second major element in the BBE system is the augmentation of the higher and lower frequencies. Loudspeakers tend to be less efficient in their extreme treble and bass ranges. Most sound-reproducing systems include a circuit for boosting high and low frequencies, showing an accepted awareness of the loudspeaker's efficiency problem. The BBE system, however, provides a dynamic, program-driven augmentation which combines with the phase compensation feature to restore the brilliance and clarity of the original live sound. The result is, as one professional journal phrased it, ""The most hearable advance in audio technology since high fidelity itself!""",BBE Sound

Whether you play in a stadium, bar, or rehearsal space, they all have one thing in common, the AC power is supplied from your local utility. What?s worse is that the ?power factor? supplied from your building?s AC outlet is typically poor, thanks to increasingly overtaxed power lines and raised line impedance.  In fact, the quality of AC power has been so poor for so long, most musicians have no idea how great their amplifiers could really sound. When the AC power factor is poor, amplifiers sound muddy because their power supplies can?t deliver when pushed. The scream and cry from a guitar loses bite and harmonics, basses lose their punch and weight, keyboards sound nasal, losing clarity, attack, and extension. Not so with Furman?s Power Factor Pro.  The Power Factor Pro?s Clear Tone Technology actually lowers the AC line impedance supplied by your wall outlet, while storing energy for peak current demands. In fact, there are over 45 Amps of instantaneous current reserve in the Power Factor Pro. Additionally, Linear Filtering Technology dramatically lowers AC line noise to unprecedented levels in the critical audio frequency band. What does this mean? Just plug in your current starved amplifier, crank up the volume, and listen to the dynamics, harmonics, and clarity you?ve been missing!

Great for blues, funk, classic rock, southern rock, jam, and hard rock. This is a direct replacement for 4-string MusicMan StingRay basses from 1976 to present. MusicMan used Alnico magnets on the original 1976 StingRay basses. These groundbreaking instruments are some of the most highly collectable basses of their era, and are known for producing some of the most popular bass tones for metal, rock, blues and funk. Installing a ceramic magnet in a conventional humbucker will tend to make it brighter and edgier with a punchy bass response and a higher resonant peak. However in the case of Seymour Duncan's SMB-4A MusicMan replacement pickup, the Alnico magnets, together with unique coil windings, have the effect of extending both ends of the frequency spectrum beyond that of their ceramic magnet counterparts. In other words, the SMB-4A Alnico version is both warmer on the bottom and more detailed on the top. Seymour Duncan uses .375"" (3/8"") diameter Alnico 5 rod pole pieces and a winding spec that's designed to product the same resonance as the original 1976 StingRay. The SMB-4A is hand-built in the Seymour Duncan Basslines facility in Santa Barbara, California. Mounting hardware and detailed wiring diagram included. Comes with four-conductor hookup cable and Basslines logo cover. The SMB-4A is generally used together with the STC-3M3 Tone Circuit for optimal tonal control. Players include Darrell Harris / Gary Puckett, Dan Lutz / Andy Summers, Roger Camero / No Motiv.",Seymour Duncan

In the early to mid 1980's, the Vater brothers began producing private-label drumsticks alongside sticks for Vic Firth and Zildjian. A few years of this led to the brothers deciding to move their business to a new factory in Holbrook MA. Over the past decade, the Vater family and product line has expanded greatly, introducing innovative products such as the Splash Stick and Acoustic, and welcoming renowned drummers like Chad Smith, Stewart Copeland, and Josh Freeze.

With Pignose, anywhere you practice, (hotel room. garage, limo, kitchen, dressing room or a place in the park), becomes your rehearsal hall.It's a First AmpFor the student guitarist, Pignose is the ideal first amplifier. It combines economy with quality. Pignose will never outlive its usefulness as a faithful and dependable travelling, practice and recording amplifier. In addition, Pignose has a preamp outjack which makes it possible to play the Pignose through a large and more powerful amplifier. Many professional musicians have been using Pignose as a preamp while performing.It's a Performing AmpThe Pignose sound has proved so desirable that it now appeas in live performance. It's not a question of hooking 600 Pignose in series: it's done by playing into a singular Pignose and amplifying the result with the usual host of amplifiers.It's a Studio AmpIf there's a situation where sound is critical, it's in the studio. That is where Pignose will really surprise you. Pignose works in the studio for the Real Pros. For example, on any album, a guitar can first be played into Pignose, then into the board.It's Not Just a Guitar AmpAny instrument you can amplify you can play through a Pignose, including your own voice.",Pignose

That's not to say there isnt plenty of aggressive chunk in the bottom-end, because there is a spike in the mid-range that gives the pickup a subtle aw vowel sound, like a wah-wah pedal stopped in the middle. It adds drive to the high note bends and grind to notes on the low E string. The transparency of its sound lets the PAF Pro cut through heavy processing. Other pickups get lost in the mud of the effects chain. The PAF Pro is EQ'd to enhance, not fight, all the gain and processing it's sent through. The high-end is tweaked in a way that lets the pickup's character stand out regardless of how intense the situation gets. The sound of a PAF Pro combined with a single-coil pickup in the middle position adds the versatility of the traditional glassy twang to any guitar. Using a five-way pickup switch and backing off on the guitar's volume control gives you a range of tone from over the top to slashing funk rhythm. Recommended For: The PAF Pro is a dependable choice right across the board - neck and bridge positions, solid-body, semi-hollow and hollowbody guitars are equally effective uses. Tech Talk: This is a great building block pickup, because it's effective in many different situations. Try it in the neck position with a hotter bridge pickup - anything from a Norton to a Super Distortion will create a calibrated 2-humbucker matchup. As a bridge pickup, it's really effective with single-coils, because it won't drown them out with too much power, and it's bright enough to blend in tone-wise.",DiMarzio
