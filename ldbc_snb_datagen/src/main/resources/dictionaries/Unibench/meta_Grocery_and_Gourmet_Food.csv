About Trans FatWhen it comes to fat, trans fat is considered by some doctors to be the worst type of fat. Unlike other fats, trans fat also called trans-fatty acids both raises your ""bad"" (LDL) cholesterol and lowers your ""good"" (HDL) cholesterol. A high LDL cholesterol level in combination with a low HDL cholesterol level increases your risk of heart disease, the leading killer of men and women. Here's some information about trans fat and how to avoid it. What is Trans Fat?Trans fat is made by adding hydrogen to vegetable oil through a process called hydrogenation, which makes the oil less likely to spoil. Using trans fats in the manufacturing of foods helps foods stay fresh longer, have a longer shelf life and have a less greasy feel. Scientists aren't sure exactly why, but the addition of hydrogen to oil increases your cholesterol more than do other types of fats.",Cafix

About the same time in England, a revolutionary method of producing ammonium carbonate, by the distillation of deer horns was developed and became commonly known as ""Hartshorn"". Eventually, this form of ammonium carbonate became more readily known as ""Bakers Ammonia"", which it is still referred to in today?s baking industry. ""Bakers Ammonia"", or ammonium carbonate, is a uniform high purity leavening agent, produced by a chemical reaction of ammonia, carbon dioxide and water. Ammonium carbonate is a product of exceptionally high quality and should not be confused with ammonium bicarbonate, which has a lower ammonia content. Ammonium carbonate is a white crystalline powder which yields a strong ammoniacal odor. It decomposes into ammonia, carbon dioxide and water at elevated temperatures. This unique property of complete decomposition into gaseous products at temperatures above 59oC is one of the most important features of this product. Decomposition occurs slowly when ammonium carbonate is opened to the atmosphere, but increases significantly when exposed to higher temperatures normally used in the baking process. Ammonium carbonate can be dissolved in water at room temperature, which is a convenient way to add to dough for even distribution.",Oasis Supply

The tree is noted for its tall, braided trunk, spiraling upwards into an umbrella of glossy, green foliage. Easy-to-grow, this indoor variety makes the perfect gift for beginners. This bonsai is four years old, 10 to 12 inches tall, and comes in a 10-inch, glazed, rectangular pot. Every tree order includes specific growing instructions.Delivery and Packaging: What to expect when you receive your bonsaiTo ensure only well-established, healthy trees are shipped, Brussel's Bonsai imports its trees from nurseries in China where growers spend years training and shaping tree branches. Some bonsai defoliate (drop leaves) when their environment changes. If upon the tree's arrival some leaves have dropped or turned slightly brown that does not mean the bonsai is unhealthy. Defoliation is the natural result of being in the low-light environment of a shipping box. Whenever possible, Brussel&#146;s Bonsai avoids using Styrofoam-popcorn packaging. In some cases, Styrofoam popcorn must be used to safely pack unusually shaped bonsai. Organic popcorn packaging made from corn starch reacts with moisture from the trees and can dissolve. When you receive your tree, place the box in a shaded area to unpack. Inspect tree for damage to branches or leaves. Water soil if dry. Place each bonsai in protected shade for at least one week before moving to a sunny location.What is a Bonsai?Literally, the Japanese word ""bonsai"" means ""tray tree"" or ""plant grown in a pot."" The term refers to the artistic techniques used to capture the natural beauty of trees, rather than a specific variety of tree. A full-grown tree and a bonsai can be grown from the same seed --the bonsai has simply been dwarfed and shaped through years of training. To develop authentic bonsai, Brussels grows specimens under carefully controlled conditions, meticulously training each tree with wire and pruning over a period of years. The value of a particular bonsai typically depends on size, age, and training. Generally, more expensive trees are larger, older, and have had more detailed, elaborate training. These qualities combined create the illusion of a large tree in a natural setting.Tropical/Indoor Bonsai CareClimateSuited to bright, humid, equatorial climates, tropical bonsai prefer common room temperatures, between 65 and 75 degrees F, 3 to 4 hours of direct sunlight, and humidity levels of about 75%. If your home tends to be dry, a cool mist humidifier or ceramic bonsai humidity tray can help mimic the moist, tropical climate ideal for growing indoor bonsai.PlacementIndoor bonsai are tropical plants adaptable to indoor conditions. Select a spot with good air circulation, but avoid cold drafts, drying heat vents, and appliances with heat exhausts. They prefer sunny areas near windows facing southeast or west. Choose a location that receives morning sun and afternoon shade. Though they grow well indoors year-round, tropical bonsai flourish outdoors on a patio or deck that receives indirect sunlight. They can withstand outdoor summer temperatures up to 100 degrees F, as well as dryer, desert climates as long as they are watered adequately. Bring bonsai indoors when night temperatures fall below 55 degrees F. Do not allow tropical bonsai to freeze.In Japan, bonsai are traditionally displayed against a solid black, white, wood, or bamboo background, or on a stand or pot larger than the tree. Stark contrasts enhance a bonsai&#146;s simple beauty.WateringIn fall, winter and spring, water tropical bonsai thoroughly every two or three days. In hot summer months, water daily--especially in dry, hot climates. Use a can or hose attachment that casts a soft, rain-like spray that won&#146;t disturb the soil in the pot. Bonsai can never be allowed to dry out.Soil and fertilizerBonsai trees spend years in the same soil and eventually deplete the available nutrients. Providing supplemental nutrition is essential for a healthy tree. Most water soluble and time-released fertilizers work well when used as directed.Run wire through drainTrim rootballWork soil into rootsRepottingBonsai need to be repotted every 3 to 5 years. After receiving your tree, wait at least one growing season before repotting. Using proper bonsai soil is critical. Brussel&#146;s bonsai soil consists of a mixture of high-fired clay particles and finely ground pine bark. The soil-free mix does not compact, allows water to drain easily, plus helps prevent the root rot that often occurs with ordinary potting soil.It is important to pot your bonsai correctly. Prepare your container for potting by putting screen over the drain holes Run wire through the drain screen--you will need this to secure the tree in the container. Trim the rootball so it will fit in the bonsai pot.  Keep in mind, cutting larger roots is better than cutting small feeder roots. Continue trimming the root ball until it will fit into the bonsai container. Be sure to place a good layer of bonsai soil on the bottom of the bonsai container.Place the tree in the pot. Use the wire to secure the tree in the bonsai container. Twist and pull the wire with pliers to tighten. Add bonsai soil around the root ball. Use a chopstick to work the bonsai soil into the root system. Your bonsai should now be secure in its new container.TrainingAll bonsai require some degree of seasonal pruning. Regular pruning produces smaller branches and maintains the tree&#146;s miniature size. A simple pair of pointed-nose scissors does the job. Wiring may also be used to hold branches in a desired position or location. If you&#146;re happy with the branch placement as is, there is no real need to wire. For detailed instruction in the art of bonsai cultivation, Brussel&#146;s Bonsai recommends purchasing a book on basic training techniques.If you choose to wire your bonsai, make sure to use heavier gauge wire for larger branches on the bottom of the tree, and lighter gauge for smaller branches. Begin by sticking the end of the wire into the soil next to the trunk of the tree. Wrap the wire around the trunk until you come to the first branch. Continue curling the wire around the branch. Once you have come to the end of a branch, cut and remove the excess wire. The wire now allows you to bend the branch into the desired shape and location.LifespanMost bonsai trees can live up to 100 years or more depending, of course, on the quality of care they receive.The Story of Brussel's Bonsai NurseryWhen Brussel Martin was five years old, he was instantly captivated by several bonsai his father brought back from a California business trip. As a teenager, he began to seriously study the art of bonsai. What started as an artistic endeavor in his parents' backyard quickly grew into a business. In the 1970s, he began selling bonsai through the mail and traveling to shows across the country. By the early '80s, he was making annual buying trips to Asia.As the business has grown, so has his desire to introduce bonsai to more and more Americans. Brussels now offers a full range of bonsai trees, from modestly priced bonsai for the beginner to unique specimens styled by bonsai experts.",Brussel&#39;s Bonsai

Eaten as a table cheese, Raclette has a smooth, creamy taste that is neither too salty nor sharp. However, our French Raclette tends to have a strong, pungent aroma that is not for the timid. This cheese is traditionally melted (a half wheel is placed in a fireplace, then the melted top surface is continuously scraped off) and layered atop boiled potatoes, pickles, fresh vegetables, and sliced meats. Check out our recipes and try it for yourself! .Made from pasteurized cow's milk.Photo depicts whole 8 lb. form of cheese.We cut and wrap this item(4 lbs).Please contact us if you would like to purchase the whole form.Please note: The cheese is cut to fit a raclette machine.",igourmet

This tea gets its character from the special smoking process used in its production. After plucking, the leaves are withered in bamboo baskets over pine or cypress wood fires. Then, they are pan fried and rolled. After the rolling process, they are placed in wooden barrels to develop their pleasant aroma. Finally, they are placed in bamboo baskets and hung on racks, once again over smoky pine fires, where they dry and absorb the essence of the smoke. The finished tea leaves are thick and black. When steeped in hot water, they produce a bright reddish-orange cup of tea. The flavor and aroma are very assertive, appealing to those who like a bold cup of tea.",igourmet

For use in baking and for making soya milk. Diets low in saturdated fat and cholesterol that include 25 grams of soya protein a day may reduce the risk of heart disease. One serving of Fearn Soya Powder provides 10 grams of soya protein. Processed for natural flavor.Soybeans belong to the legume family along with peanuts, lentils and more types of beans and peas. While grains such as wheat, corn, rye, etc can be ground directly into flour, soybeans and other legumes require cooking before they are eaten in order to enhance nutrition, digestibility and flavor. Fearn Soya Powder is made from good quality soybeans by washing the beans in water and then steam cooking at a maximum temperature of 215 degrees F. The hulls are removed to avoid grittiness and because they are not a good source of nutrients anyway. The final step is grinding into a fine powder.We do not enhance our product with additional isoflavones. Studies to date show no added benefits to having more than the naturally occuring levels of approximately 2 milligrams per 1 gram of protein present in our product. No solvents or other processing agents are used and nothing is added. Natural Soya Powder is 100% natural, 100% soybean product. We hope you enjoy its rich, nutty flavor. What's the difference between Soya Powder and Soya Flour?Soya flour is made by grinding whole dry soybeans into flour in the same way wheat kernels are ground into flour. Soy flour often contains considerable hull material, is more coarse and may even be raw. Soy flour is often dry-toasted after grinding to improve flavor and digestibility. It may be used in baking recipes. Soya Powder is made by cooking the soybeans before grinding. Soya Powder is finer than soy flour and usually has a better flavor. It may be used to make soya milk and it may also be used in baking recipes. Fearn Natural Soya Powd",Fearn

It makes a nice tea for a fussy child (or adult), and it helps to soothe the tummy and to reduce restlessness at bedtime. Botanical Family: Asteraceae Botanical name: Matricaria recutita L. Common name: German chamomile Constituents of Note: The essential oil, present at 0.3 to 1.9%, is the most important constituent in chamomile and is valued in aromatherapy oil. Key constituents of the oil include chamazulene, alpha-bisabolol, bisabolol oxides A and B and bisabolene. The chamazulene develops during steam distillation, giving the essential oil its characteristic blue color, but it is not present in flowers. German chamomile flowers also contain flavonoids (apigenin, apigetrin, querciten), coumarins, proazulenes, triterpene alcohols, sterols, sesquiterpenes, plant acids and tannins. Did you know? In the children's story Peter Rabbit, Peter's mother gives him chamomile tea (after a proper scolding) before sending him to bed after his return from Mr. McGregor's farm. No doubt the chamomile tea helped to soothe both Peter's nerves (after his harrowing escape) and his tummy (after feasting on the farmer's produce). Flavorful, comforting, gentle, traditional chamomile tea is made with German chamomile flowers. A versatile herb, chamomile is also an ingredient in shampoos and conditioners for light colored hair, in skin care creams and lotions, and in relaxing bath blends.",Frontier

Soy Flour gives home-baked goods a protein boost. It also helps baked goods from becoming stale. It adds a rich color, fine texture, tenderness and moistness to baked goods. Since soy flour is free of gluten, which gives structure to yeast-raised breads, soy flour can no replace all of the wheat or rye flour in bread recipe. However using about 15% soy flour in a recipe produces a dense bread with a nutty flavor and a wonderful moist quality. Just place two tablespoons of soy flour in your measuring cup before measuring all-purpose of other flour called for in the recipe.In baked products that are not yeast-raised, up to 1/4 the total amount of flour called for in the recipe can be replaced with soy flour.

The extract with less than 95% concentration of the sweet substances of the leaves ( they are referred to as ""crude extracts) might have a bitter aftertaste because of the non-sweet particles mixed with the powder.

As a result of this hard work and dedication, the Stevita brand is recognized as the number one in quality among all the stevia products available in the market. How is Stevia pronounced?This plant was first discovered by Spanish explorers in the 16th century while looking for gold in the areas between Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina..

One of the world's most popular spices, cumin is extremely aromatic, with a warm, spicy, slightly bitter, earthy flavor. Cumin seeds are enjoyed around the world but especially in North African, Middle Eastern, Indian and Mexican cuisines. Botanical name: Cuminum cyminum L. A low-growing, tender, annual member of the carrot and parsley (Umbelliferae) family. The yellowish-brown fruit of the plant--cumin seed as we know it--is elongated, with nine ridges. Cumin seeds resemble caraway seeds in appearance, although close inspection shows that the cumin seed is straighter, longer, and greener than the caraway seed. (Poppy seed and turmeric, to a lesser extent, also served as blockers.) Egyptians used cumin around 5000 B.C. both to season meats, fish, and stews and to mummify their dead. The Romans used it as a substitute for pepper, and the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius was nicknamed ""the cumin splitter"" because he was frugal in his personal life in order to help provide money for social projects. In the Middle Ages, when cumin was very popular, Europeans believed it would keep poultry from wandering away and ensure fidelity between couples.",Frontier

Native to the Balkan Peninsula and northern and western Turkey (it is often noted that the exact natural range is uncertain due to extensive early cultivation). Also found as an introduced or naturalized plant through most of Europe and the Mediterranean area as well as in North America. Cultivated throughout the temperate region. Spearmint is an herbaceous rhizomatous (forms lateral stems on top of the ground that ""creep"" to form subsequent plants) perennial plant 30-100 cm tall. It features bright green, sharply pointed, toothed, lance-shaped leaves and flowers in slender, terminal spikes, pink or white, from June-August. The plant should be harvested just before or right as flowers open, as the aromatic components diminish once flowering has ceased. Commercial product is entirely cultivated from vegetative cuttings due to the high degree of inconsistency in plants grown from seed.

(453 g) Frontier Natural Products Certified Organic Whole Cumin Seed contains non-irradiated cumin seeds that are freshness dated. One of the world's most popular spices, cumin is extremely aromatic, with a warm, spicy, slightly bitter, earthy flavor. Cumin seeds are enjoyed around the world but especially in North African, Middle Eastern, Indian and Mexican cuisines. Botanical name: Cuminum cyminum L. A low-growing, tender, annual member of the carrot and parsley (Umbelliferae) family. The yellowish-brown fruit of the plant, cumin seed as we know it, is elongated, with nine ridges. Cumin seeds resemble caraway seeds in appearance, although close inspection shows that the cumin seed is straighter, longer, and greener than the caraway seed. (Poppy seed and turmeric, to a lesser extent, also served as blockers.) Egyptians used cumin around 5000 B.C. both to season meats, fish, and stews and to mummify their dead. The Romans used it as a substitute for pepper, and the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius was nicknamed ""the cumin splitter"" because he was frugal in his personal life in order to help provide money for social projects. In the Middle Ages, when cumin was very popular, Europeans believed it would keep poultry from wandering away and ensure fidelity between couples. The Germans carried cumin, dill and salt in their pockets when being wed, and in parts of Europe, a soldier would share a farewell wine powdered with cumin or carry with him a loaf of cumin bread baked by his sweetheart.",Frontier

The botanical name Coriandrum sativum comes from the Greek koris, a reference to a type of bedbug that smells a bit like the foliage of the coriander plant.

The green seed also gives off this odor, but develops a soft, spicy scent--like a combination of orange, anise and cumin - when thoroughly aged and dried. Indigenous to Asia Minor and the Mediterranean region, cilantro is easy to grow and is cultivated in many countries around the world, including the U.S. and Mexico.

All natural. Beneficial everyday tea. Green tea with Jasmine flowers. Mild fragrant flavor. Delicious hot or iced. Ancient Chinese herbs & teas. Jasmine, native to the Persian Gulf, was brought to China in the third century A.D. Green tea enriched with the scent of jasmine flowers has long been one of the favorite healthy beverages of China. Traditionally, jasmine was regarded as having comforting, relaxing and warming qualities. It was considered to help brighten one's mood, and was used as a soothing beneficial beverage. Our tea is made from mild green tea leaves combined with fragrant jasmine flowers, creating a delicious aromatic beverage, in the traditional Chinese style. Considerable research on green tea has shown it to be high in polyphenols, a group of powerful antioxidants. Experts recommend drinking three or more cups of green tea a day. Make this healthful tea a part of your daily diet, just as Asian people do. Enjoy it hot or iced. Traditional Chinese medicine began in approximately 2500 B.C. Recently, here in the West, people have discovered the value of this ancient system which focuses on aiding the body's own healing mechanisms through restoring harmony and balance. The Chinese system of herbology has been recorded in ancient texts which are studied and employed even today. This time tested knowledge has been passed on from generation to generation over the centuries. Triple Leaf Tea comes from such a tradition. It is made in the U.S.A. by a Chinese American family-owned business. The company owner can remember stories of his own grandfather selling herbs and teas in his village in China. Today, these traditional Chinese herbal formulas are available to you. We wish you harmony and balance! We use oxygen bleached tea bags.

It seems that green tea has been found to contain antioxidants called polyphenols. Polyphenols neutralize free radicals in your body thus helping you stay healthier. Green Tea, when you brew it, is very pale in color and quite delicate in flavor. Many people enjoy Green Tea just as is but others prefer Green Tea with a little added flavor. For those who want more flavor, Bigelow Teas has a great selection to choose from including ""Constant Comment"" Green Tea and Earl Grey Green Tea. And, most importantly, each and every Bigelow green tea bag has been overwrapped and sealed in a stay fresh foil packet so that all the goodness stays in until you get ready to have a cup of tea. Green tea is a soothing brew with a mild and subtle flavor. Its smooth mouthfeel lingers on the palate and extends the overall taste experience. This tea is a great complement to subtly flavored foods such as seafood, rice, salad and chicken. History of TeaFrom Buddhist monks using it in their religious ceremonies to American revolutionaries tossing it in to Boston Harbor, tea has become more than a beverage; it has become an event. For nearly 5,000 years this drink has been a source of medicine, meditation, piracy, political upheaval, social order, congregation, and superstition. While the roles tea has played in Eastern and Western civilization are abundant, it is derived from a plant native to Central and Eastern Asia.
