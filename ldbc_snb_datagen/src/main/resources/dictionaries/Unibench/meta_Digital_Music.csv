Once you realize that the sublime singer and expert fiddler you hear is a mere 15 years old, it becomes extraordinary. True, hearing a 15-year-old sing about ""my whiskey on ice"" and other such mature themes is a bit disconcerting, but what amazes is not what she's singing about but the masterful command she has over her angelic voice. And her fiddle licks are even more impressive. The record simply oozes potential and poise, even if the best was yet to come.--Marc Greilsamer","KRAUSS,ALISON"

A traditionalist might say this is because Krauss and her band, Union Station, offer a kind of ""bluegrass-lite"" that's cut with pop sensibility, absent any manic-fast picking, and awash in Krauss's goes-down-easy vocal. Nonetheless, this is a solid album that pushed Krauss deservedly further into the limelight. Highlights include the title track, Union Station banjo picker Ron Block's fine gospel number ""Shield of Faith,"" and the traditional instrumental ""Cluck Old Hen.""--Anders Smith-Lindall","KRAUSS,ALISON"

The ploy worked, yielding a wonderful, odds-beating crossover hit with Krauss's cover of &quot;Baby, Now That I've Found You,&quot; a carousing late-'60s pop chant transformed into a delicate, vulnerable declaration of love. Focusing on Krauss's lovely, yearning soprano, the track elevated the musician above her resolutely democratic role in her quintet, catapulting Krauss to the biggest bluegrass success story in over 30 years. Krauss has stayed true to her bluegrass roots, as well as to Union Station, but this cross-section of contemporary bluegrass songs, joyous gospel, and canny rock covers testifies to the young artist's luminous appeal.--Sam Sutherland","KRAUSS,ALISON"

Whatever style she chooses, her flawless voice and her crack Union Station cohorts usually maintain a high standard. The instrumental &quot;Little Liza Jane&quot; and the traditional &quot;I'll Remember You, Love, In My Prayers&quot; prove their instrumental chops, and songs like &quot;No Place to Hide,&quot; with an impressive fiddle turn from Krauss herself, effectively mold modern elements into the bluegrass idiom. However, others such as &quot;It Doesn't Matter&quot; and &quot;Deeper Than Crying&quot; have very little to do with bluegrass at all.

Barely past the threshold of womanhood, Krauss possesses musical agility far beyond her years, as well as the soft sweetness of the girlhood blush. The efficacy with which she and her band approach each song is marrow deep and tenderly precise, be it on the banjo rave-up ""Will You Be Leaving"" or the multi-string delay-beat of ""Winter of a Broken Heart."" Witness to the promise of a stellar future is theFloyd Cramer-esque piano-led ""Tonight I'll Be Lonely Too,"" in which Krauss shines like the sun, her splendidly emotive tone and phrasing somewhat reminiscent of a youngDolly Parton.--Paige La Grone","KRAUSS,ALISON"

It's a familiar formula, but Coolio makes it fresh again, coming up with monologues strong enough to make us forget the original songs and get lost in his narratives.

He's more than ably supported by Charlie Haden and Jack DeJohnette, with Haden's fundamentalist approach to the bass acting as a secure anchor to Rubalcaba's frequent flights of virtuosity and DeJohnette's polyrhythmic approach. With his deep roots in the rhythmic language of Cuban music, Rubalcaba brings a subtle and complex pulse to even his most reflective moments at the keyboard. He's also rooted in some of the more adventurous paths that jazz took in the 1960s, as that stellar rhythm section would suggest.

This is meant as no disrespect to the Chieftains, who dominated the genre in times past and continue to make good music today, but Altan have achieved a musical peak that's impossible to ignore. Because most of their vocals are in Gaelic rather than English and because their instrumental dance tunes stick close to their folk origins, Altan may be less accessible than the Chieftains, but the sheer beauty of the music will reward the patient listener. Two Nashville figures--singer Alison Krauss and dobroist Jerry Douglas--as well as Chieftains flutist Matt Molloy help out on Altan's new album,Runaway Sunday, but the recording is dominated by Altan's co-founder and undisputed leader, Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh, a virtuoso of the legendary fiddle tradition of her native County Donegal. With her quick bow, she is able to articulate each individual note, no matter how quickly it passes by, and to string them together into lines that seem to sing. And when she sings herself, her soprano has the same resonant tone and sure phrasing as her violin. Her five bandmates (who play accordion, bouzouki, second fiddle and two acoustic guitars) follow her so closely that the group seems to move and breathe as one.Instrumentals, organized into six medleys and a stand-alone piece, dominate, but it's the quality of the songs that make this the most impressive Altan album yet. Ni Mhaonaigh has found a kindred spirit in Krauss, and only a slight Irish accent separates the two singers on an exquisite version of Robert Burns's &quot;I Wish My Love Was a Red Red Rose.&quot; Ni Mhaonaigh herself wrote &quot;A Moment in Time&quot; as a tribute to the older Irish musicians who passed the tradition on to her generation, and the lyrics' visual details, the slow, surprising melody, and the breathy vocal all convey an unmistakable affection. The album climaxes with &quot;Time Has Passed,&quot; Ni Mhaonaigh's heart-breaking elegy for her late husband and former co-bandleader, Frankie Kennedy.--Geoffrey Himes",

So what becomes the album's big hit? The title track, aJimi Hendrixrip-off if there ever was one. Kravitz backslides elsewhere, too: ""Is There Any Love in Your Heart"" is plainly drawn fromLed Zeppelinand ""Eleutheria"" fromBob Marley, while ""Believe"" takes a more inventive approach--its chorus is in the style of theBeatles, while the verses and guitar solo again recall Led Zep.

Beginning as a sideman in the late-'40s, he worked with Charlie Parker, Fats Navarro, Bud Powell, Max Roach, Clifford Brown, Thelonious Monk, Art Blakey, and Miles Davis. Since recording his first date as a leader in 1954, Rollins has recorded dozens of albums for numerous labels, eventually settling in for a long stay on Milestone.Way Out West, recorded in 1957, is one of two superb albums cut for the small, California-based Contemporary label (the other is 1958'sSonny Rollins and the Contemporary Leaders).     Although a consummate sideman, Rollins rarely seems at ease with his pianists on his own dates, andWay Out West's trio format, with bassist Ray Brown and drummer Shelly Manne, dispenses with that problem. The tenorman's playful humor is evident in the album's selections, which include such unlikely candidates as &quot;Wagon Wheels&quot; and &quot;I'm an Old Cowhand&quot;--both elevated to previously unimaginable heights. This is a remarkably confident album--relaxed, swinging, thoughtful and deeply satisfying. And just in case that's not enough, the cover photo, featuring Rollins in Stetson and holster with his horn on his hip, is about as cool as it gets.--Fred Goodman",

Tracks like ""Early in the Morning"" and ""Outstanding"" are just ripe for sampling, and ""Shake"" and ""Burn Rubber"" throw you back in time, grooving on a dance floor and bobbin' your head. The adrenaline only slows for superslick ballads like ""Yearning for Your Love."" A blueprint for today's R&B.;--Rebecca Wallwork",Mercury

Whether Twain is a modern-day Dolly Parton or a country music Spice Girl is a matter of perspective. But with her third album, she accentuates the sing-along choruses and simple dance rhythms while downplaying the country elements. As a pop move, it works wonderfully for her, earning Twain a valued spot on MTV, VH-1, and pop radio. The emphasis is on fun rather than depth, of course. But no one can accuse her of being stingy: she and her Svengali-like producer/husband, slick-rock king Robert ""Mutt"" Lange (Def Leppard, Bryan Adams, AC/DC), load down the album with 16 songs, all of them quite radio-friendly.--Michael McCall",Umgd/Mercury Nashville

Like Hayes (a chart maker since 1969), White had a deep baritone that made him a natural musical ""lover man,"" and even though his physique was a real contrast to the sexy image ofMarvin Gayeor an early-'70sAl Green, the multitalented producer, songwriter, and artist knew that he had the kind of vocal style to win over a primarily female audience.With this, his very first album, White's music clearly had plenty of bedroom appeal. Using the same technique as Hayes, with extended songs that lasted several minutes, White helped put a lock on midnight love anthems. In addition to the pop and R&B; smash ""I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby"" and his own standouts, ""Back My Yesterday"" and ""I've Found Someone,"" White took theFour Tops' ""Standing in the Shadows of Love"" and turned it into a veritable opus.

Tapping U2's producer, Steve Lillywhite, then known for his highly textured, expansive sound, Adamson realized his vision on Big Country's 1983 debut. Propelled by the hit single &quot;In a Big Country,&quot; and featuring such rousingly evocative fare as &quot;Fields of Fire&quot; and &quot;Harvest Home,&quot; the group's decidedly Scotch-Irish tone prefigured the Celtic music boom by a good 10 years.--Billy Altman",

Lead singer/producer Larry Blackmon insisted on changing with the times, and he did so by making Cameo more high-tech. An outlandish, in-your-face stage presence, a strange sense of humor, and a hard-driving funk sound that criss-crossed a few musical boundaries earned Cameo countless comparisons to Parliament/Funkadelic in their early days. However, Cameo eventually wore off accusations of being derivative by transcending their influences and outlasting almost every single one of them. Throughout the '70s and '80s, the group remained up with the times and occasionally crept ahead of them, such that they became influences themselves upon younger generations of R&B; and hip-hop acts.

The 1993 collection's mercilessly driven, bluesy songs--nearly all dripping with sensual lyrics and rousing rhythms--made it the ideal breeding ground for a couple of career-enhancing music videos. The eerily possessive rock ballad ""Come to My Window"" hit the tube first with a bizarre twofold portrait of Etheridge and her guitar and actress Juliette Lewis having a nervous breakdown. This single brought the album into the public consciousness and was quickly followed by the similarly obsessive, slow-groovin' ""I'm the Only One"" and the co-dependence-battling ""If I Wanted To."" But the album's real strength is in the hidden gems untouched by MTV programmers.

While he claims one song won't &quot;be getting no airplay&quot; due to its heavy profanity, in reality the vocals are heavily expurgated. LL tries to play both sides, but he can't escape his nice-guy, TV-ready self. He even celebrates his second career on &quot;Hollis to Hollywood,&quot; a rap full of movie wordplay (&quot;I'm making Speed like I'm Keanu Reeves / But too many True Lies can make a honey bleed&quot;).

But in the devalued hip-hop universe of the late 1990s--where political activism is irrelevant, and entrepreneurial mediocrities like Puff Daddy and Master P hold sway--it's tempting to hail him as a conquering hero. Tempting, but mistaken. For one thing, he lacks the pipes to be considered among the truly great MCs (Chuck D, Guru, Ice Cube, Method Man). For another, his rhymes--both structurally and in terms of subject-matter--are way too simplistic. Rather than draw any conclusions from his world, or postulate any form of action, Jay simply calls 'em like he sees 'em--a post-Biggie dialectic of thinly-veiled threats (""Friend or Foe '98"", ""Face Off"") and dreary self-aggrandisment (""I Know What Girls Like"", ""City Is Mine"").

""Bombtrack"" opens the LP with a shot of adrenaline and singer Zack de la Rocha's infuriated chorus of ""Burn, burn, yes, you're gonna burn!"" The intensity doesn't let up an inch on the militant ""Killing in the Name"" (with the inspiring chant, ""Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me!""), the ultrafunky ""Bullet in the Head,"" and the engrossing ""Fistful of Steel.""

Her coolly delivered, deeply felt songs include meditations on family, community, and social injustice without rant or cant, never more so than on the gently incisive midlife reflections of the title song, which filters historic milestones and childhood lessons through its delicate verses. Elsewhere, she sketches a heart-breaking, restrained speculation on the inner life of a blind, deaf mystery man (&quot;John Doe No. 24&quot;) with the economy and detail of good short story. The set's many love songs are no less intelligent, emotionally authentic, or moving.

And how can they be so enthusiastic about it?III (Temples of Boom)exhales the same clouded sentiments of past albums, but offers no answers.Herb is never far from the conversation on Cypress Hill records--how they smoke more than anyone, how they were rapping about it before anyone--but they never explain why, never suggest they derive something positive (or negative) from pot. ThoughIII's &quot;Illusions&quot; begins with an Indian sitar, presumably a reference to '60s drug culture's Eastern influence, there's no expanded consciousness in the accompanying raps.

The recording also exposes an unfortunate tendency to present trite, hackneyed sentiments as if they were oracular visions from a young prophet to a jaded world. For the most part, Jewel sings to her own acoustic guitar accompaniment, but she has a lot more in common with, say, the Indigo Girls or Lisa Loeb than with Judy Collins or Nanci Griffith. Despite her soft soprano and pretty melodies, her songs have an iconoclastic edge which make her more of an unplugged alternative rocker than a folkie. Her songs too often betray their origins as written verse in their hard-to-sing meters, unmusical phrasing, and diary-like pronouncements.

Though it sounds like a recruitment slogan for Little League soccer, the name actually refers to the lost temples of feminine divinity. Pele, you see, is the Hawaiian volcano goddess; the boys, well, they're the sacrifices that quell the rumbling lady's rage. Attempting to regain fires stolen long ago, Pele rewrites the crucifixion to star a girl Jesus and in doing so conjures a forgotten matriarchal mythology. While Amos's characters--Jupiter, Muhammad, Lucifer--are male by name, the aural landscape into which they're thrown is as symbolically and expressionistically female as Georgia O'Keeffe's skull-and-roses paintings.Peleis a complex and formless--and often impenetrable--work of gothic-pop chamber music, both beautiful and ghostly in its nearly complete reliance on Amos's rolling Bosendorfer grand piano, chilling harpsichord (which she bangs like a courtly punk rocker), and acrobatic voice (as earthy as Joni Mitchell's and as otherworldly as Bjork's). Unfortunately, she takes us only halfway: her songs engage and challenge us to understand, but the imagery offers few clues to help us crack their frustrating opacity.Peleends up as much a pretentious and self-indulgent trip as it is a synthesis of talent, imagination, and skewed vision. Still, there's reason to celebrate that an album as formalistically and thematically alien to pop audiences asPelewould win such quick success upon its original release.--Roni Sarig",Wea2

While Redding always lent his own special raw, gospel-edged stamp to everything from the Beatles' perky ""Day Tripper"" to a slowed-down, unparalleled reading of the pop standard ""Tennessee Waltz,"" it was on his own songs--such gems as ""Fa- Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)"" (his 15th R&B; hit single), the plaintive ""Ton of Joy,"" and the bluesy ""Hawg for You""--that Redding was at his soulful best. That said, nothing quite compares to how he turned another pop classic, ""Try a Little Tenderness"" into an emotive opus that became a showstopper wherever he appeared during his tragically short-lived four years as a hit-making recording artist. As an example of the horn-driven Memphis sound,Dictionary of Soulis an excellent reference, and Redding is in peak form as a true American original, whether he's giving '50s hit man Chuck Willis's ""You're Still My Baby"" a workover or breezing through his own almost-joyful ""She Put the Hurt on Me.""

Though the title track of IF YOU COULD READ MY MIND was indeed his first massive pop hit, the album proves that Lightfoot was a serious, substantive song craftsman. ""Minstrel of the Dawn"" is a ""Mr. Tambourine Man""-like affair that closes on a surprisingly sarcastic note. ""Sit Down Young Stranger"" and ""Cobwebs & Dust"" are the folkiest cuts, and each bears an incisive, poetic lyricism. The bluesy ""Baby It's Alright"" and a cover of Kris Kristofferson's ""Me and Bobby McGee"" showcase Lightfoot's rootsier tendencies, while ""Saturday Clothes"" stands out by virtue of its Bacharach-like melody and dinner-jacket chord progression.

Among the most unfortunate casualties caught inside the blast radius were the B-52's. Just two years prior, they had released their very first mainstream breakthrough album,Cosmic Thing.

Tracks like &quot;Love Shack&quot; and &quot;Roam&quot; reminded us there could be fun without responsibility. Alternately kitschy and lazy (I still insist that &quot;Deadbeat Club&quot; was a slacker anthem long before Beck's &quot;Loser&quot;),Cosmic Thingtook the B-52's signature Trekkie-camp sensibility and slowed it down just enough to click on MTV and portable radios wonderfully.

The result is superior pop-soul with Benson's fine guitar work often percolating in the background, only occasionally breaking through to take center stage, with solos often fading out on the singles versions included here.

Like Zappa, the Mr. Bungle musicians like to show off their classical, jazz, and worldbeat influences in fast, difficult passages that are technically impressive but never seem to go anywhere. All but three of the album's dozen pieces feature lyrics, but the vocals are so deeply buried in the mix that the words are virtually indecipherable.

WhileRay of Lightis being tagged as Madonna's big leap into electronica, it's important to note two things: First, her music has always had close ties to dance culture, and, second, her collaborator William Orbit is no Chemical Brother. Though it has all the latest blips, bleeps, and crackles electronica has to offer,Ray of Lightis still largely an adult album, completely within Madonna's realm. Still, Orbit's tasteful sonic constructions provide Madonna with her most adventurous, hippest musical backdrop ever. What's more, the arrangements and production are understated enough to highlight an even bigger development: Fresh from singing lessons on theEvitaset, Madonna's vocal range, depth, and clarity have never been stronger. But larger pipes don't necessarily make for deeper, truer music. Never a master lyricist, Madonna's words have worked best when they've practically been slogans (&quot;Vogue,&quot; &quot;Express Yourself&quot;). This time she goes for more emotional depth, and even tries her hand at ethno-techno-mysticism (&quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot;). She largely stumbles, however. The tone conveyed on songs like &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; is a self-centered pat on the back that belies her claim to a newfound altruism.

In this hip-hop era of exaggerated toughness, there are greater obstacles to overcome and thus the potential for even more thrilling revelations. DeVante Swing, the mastermind behind the male vocal quartet Jodeci, seizes that potential more than once on the group's new album,Diary of a Mad Band. The group shares the vocal responsibilities, but the credits on nine of the album's 13 tracks read, &quot;Music and Lyrics by DeVante Swing; Vocal arrangement: DeVante Swing; DeVante Swing: All Instruments.&quot; Thus the challenge of juggling romantic vulnerability with street credibility comes down on DeVante's 23-year-old shoulders. He fumbles the ball on a few occasions--the dumb, juvenile demands for sex on &quot;You Got It&quot; and &quot;Sweaty&quot;--but more often than not he comes through with soul ballads in the classic mode, revealing the tender heart beneath the thickened skin. The first single, &quot;Cry for You,&quot; harkens back to the slow hymns of Jodeci's church backgrounds; the singers promise, &quot;I would get on my knees for you,&quot; and the dizzying free fall of the melody underscores the total surrender of the lyrics. The next single, &quot;Feenin',&quot; is a similar confession, but it's juiced up with tape-reverse percussion sounds, a Zapp-like vocorder riff and a gruff lead set against angelic harmonies. Even &quot;Ride & Slide&quot; and &quot;Alone,&quot; rather frank sexual propositions, have the good grace to plead rather than demand; they even promise detailed attention to female erogenous zones.

There's the fluid psychedelia of ""Castles Made of Sand,"" the viciously funky ""Little Miss Lover,"" and the so-beautiful-it-hurts ""Little Wing."" Hendrix really hits altitude with ""If 6 Was 9,"" where he waves his ""freak flag high"" over a tidal wave of guitar and a cacophonous army of Moroccan flutes, and he ends with ""Bold As Love,"" based around Hendrix's typically far-fetched hankering for the axis of the planet to be tilted, thereby transforming life on earth.

It takes the form of a conventional love song (&quot;Brown sugar babe, I gets high off your love ... that's why my eyes are a shade blood burgundy&quot;) and mimics intoxication in its throbbing bass lines and reverb-heavy organ. Another song, with a title too profane to print, is a blunt tale of infidelity and murder, but in contrast to most rap fantasies, D'Angelo's blues-like narrative acknowledges such acts have serious consequences.  Best of all is the Prince-like &quot;Higher,&quot; which combines the spiritual love of God and the carnal love of a woman into one dizzying, organ-fueled hymn. D'Angelo is still rather clumsy with lyrics, and he leans too heavily on ballads over dance numbers, but he has enough talent to grow in any of several directions.

""Crazy on You,"" which spotlighted the piercing vocals of singer Ann Wilson and the chunky guitar bluster of her sister Nancy, entered the Top 40, and the more mystical ""Magic Man"" climbed to No. 9.Dreamboat Anniealso exposed a more vulnerable side of the band: The title track, for example, was an easy-listening, harmony-laden folk song replete with banjo plucks.--Jon Wiederhorn",Heart

It's the band's ninth album and second since being unearthed from the rich Ohio clay a year or two ago.So now that lead voice Robert Pollard and buddies have quit their day jobs and late-bloomed into one of today's more successful indie rock institutions, what does the band's insistence on maintaining their signature muddy humming home recordings signify when they could obviously afford better studio-quality sound? Two possibilities. One: In order to continue delivering the stuff they have built a name on, Guided by Voices have descended from stardom to self-parody quicker than any band since the Doors. Or two: Do-it-yourself is not a romanticized economic necessity, but rather a conscious artistic choice--and hence reducible to merely this year's fad.Either way,Alien Lanesfinds Guided by Voices in the frustrating position of a new-aesthetic Moses: They can lead us to the low-fi Promised Land but can't enter with us. Or in other words, the band is like a mass-marketed &quot;homemade&quot; cookie: a well-intentioned contradiction that has nevertheless outgrown its usefulness.But for everyone who still loves the music, there's a third possibility: Maybe the tape recorder is neither utility nor gimmick, but rather an irreplaceable piece of the band--even more so than any instrument or musician. That makesAlien Lanessimply a better-distributed chapter in the band's inimitable recast of classic psychedelic rock as sloppy postpunk; another collage with dozens of irresistibly cryptic song snippets shifting speeds and colors and not stopping (except for a disturbing homosexual slur half way through) until the last Beatlesque &quot;all right&quot; twenty-eight songs from go.--Roni Sarig",

So it's not a complete surprise that Brooke broke with her partner after a dozen years and recorded this project as Jonatha Brooke &amp; the Story, retaining husband/producer/keyboardist Alain Mallet and guitarist Duke Levine from the previous recordings. Unfortunately, the new format exposes the severe limitations of Brooke's voice, which is thin in tone and shrill in the upper register.Plumbis dominated by songs of heartbreak and recrimination over a relationship that is over; they may or may not be about Kimball, but the bitterness of cuts such as &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; and &quot;Is This All?&quot; emphasizes the prickliness of Brooke's singing. She needs a vocal partner to fill in the bare patches in her range and to lend some resonance to her lyric themes.

Likewise, her slightly askance vocal style seems to betray naivet&eacute;, while lyrically there is a world-weary depth that the latest spate of tough-talking Lolitas cannot muster. Each song's closely observed details create small ripples that grow to substantial emotional waves by album's end; this very promising debut should be the harbinger of great things to come from Orton, with or without the help of a Lilith Fair or anything beyond the integrity of her songs and the wise lilt of her voice.--Alan E.

This seminal release from 1990 rerouted pop music for several years, and for the better. This simple guitar/bass/drum/vocal affair cut like a searchlight through the fog of tortuously overproduced music of the time, as The Sundays proved that more is often merely more. Harriet Wheeler's lilting, swooningly sweet voice is clearly the strong driving factor behind this debut's appeal, fore-grounded through spare arrangements and an almost timid rhythm section, though the timbre of Wheeler's voice is perfectly matched to David Gavurin's terrific 12-string guitar. Taken as a whole, the album bears repeated listening, even though some of the songs tend to blur together. The hit single &quot;Here's Where the Story Ends&quot; is rivaled by, if not equal to, &quot;You're Not the Only One I Know,&quot; &quot;I Kicked a Boy,&quot; and &quot;Joy.&quot;--Alan E.

Thank God the Sundays never went grunge. On this, their second album, the forthright and spare power of their debut has ceded somewhat to lusher production values and more complex arrangements, but the good news is that the rest of the band's presence has caught up with Harriet Wheeler's crystalline voice. Together they produce such marvels as &quot;Goodbye,&quot; &quot;Love,&quot; and an off-kilter version of the Stones' &quot;Wild Horses.&quot; The Sundays here sound like a more integrated musical unit, and for that reasonBlindis the rare sophomore release that not only holds its own against the first album, but actually outperforms it.--Alan E.

The good-natured opener ""On the Sunny Side of the Street,"" complete with a lighthearted Dizzy vocal turn, doesn't even hint at the serious business to follow it. ""The Eternal Triangle"" is a quintessential bop fracas filled with inspired, white-hot improvisation. Rollins and Stitt exchange mighty blows, in solos and in trades, and Gillespie's trumpet work is no mere afterthought, bristling as it does with creativity and authority. The ensemble catches their collective breath with ""After Hours,"" a tasty slow blues introduced byRay Bryant's mood-setting piano, before they unleash a ripping reading of the chestnut ""I Know That You Know.""

In fact, the story goes that Getz had to push for the release ofGetz/Gilbertosince the company did not want to compete with its own hit; it was a good thing he did.Getz/Gilberto, which featured composer Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano, not only yielded the hit ""Girl from Ipanema"" (sung by Astrud Gilberto, the guitarist's wife, who had no professional experience) but also ""Corcovado"" (""Quiet Night"")--an instant standard, and the definitive version of ""Desafinado.""Getz/Gilbertospent 96 weeks in the charts and won four Grammys. It remains one of those rare cases in popular music where commercial success matches artistic merit. Bossa nova's ""cool"" aesthetic--with its understated rhythms, rich harmonies, and slightly detached delivery--had been influenced, in part, by cool jazz. Gilberto in particular was a Stan Getz fan. Getz, with his lyricism, the bittersweet longing in his sound, and his restrained but strong swing, was the perfect fit. His lines, at once decisive and evanescent, focus the rest of the group's performance without overpowering. A classic.--Fernando Gonzalez",

The results are naturally varied, but all point to a marvelous evolution of talent. The collection is kept together primarily by its propensity for jazzy beats and psychedelic loops. Shadow (n&eacute; Josh Davis) moves through everything from old school funk (&quot;In/Flux&quot;) to grungy '60s-style guitar raveups (&quot;High Noon&quot;). The centerpiece of the set, however, is a four-part composition called &quot;What Does Your Soul Look Like,&quot; which is likely to be the first ever entirely sample-driven rock opera. It's a brilliant piece of work, laced with intriguing sounds, sound bites, and a detectable set of motion.

With Stanley Turrentine's tenor and Kenny Burrell's guitar sharing solo space, the Hammond master digs in with a blues-drenched shovel. While certainly fluent in the bop idiom, Smith's organ work maintains a direct emotional peg that reflects the swing and jump blues of a previous generation. Turrentine, a relative newcomer at this point (1960), proves a perfect foil for Smith's funky ideas, forgoing flashy bop runs in favor of soulful, expressive passages. Even on chestnuts such as &quot;When I Grow Too Old to Dream&quot; and &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street,&quot; the foursome boils the melodies down to their barest bluesy core.

Although Morgan owed a stylistic debt to both Gillespie and Clifford Brown, he quickly developed a voice of his own that combined half-valve effects, Latin inflections, and full, fluid melodies.While many of Morgan's later sessions for Blue Note would find him paired with saxophonist Hank Mobley,The Sidewinderfeatures the then up-and-coming tenor player Joe Henderson, along with Detroit pianist Barry Harris, bassist Bob Cranshaw, and drummer Billy Higgins. Along with the title track, an unconventional 24-bar blues, the album's compositional standout is &quot;Totem Pole,&quot; a minor Latin groove featuring an outstanding solo by Henderson.

Of course, this turned out to be a lie, as did the entirety of the original liner notes.Mercy, Mercy, Mercywas not recorded at that Chicago venue, but instead at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles. (The ruse was a favor to the club owner.) The hollering audience was comprised of invited guests and stimulated by free booze. Still, their enthusiasm is definitely well warranted, as alto man Cannonball Adderley and his band offer a riveting blend of postbop calisthenics and soul-jazz grooves.Joe Zawinul's famous title track, with its hypnotic, gospel-drenched funkiness, was a crossover top 10 pop hit, as well as an astonishing exercise in restraint for Zawinul, who somehow resists the urge to dig in on his electric piano, instead opting for a deep, mellow mood.

Having made his reputation in large measure from playing with bop giantCharlie Parker, Davis confounded expectations when he embraced the ""cool"" arranging style ofGil Evans, an arranger forClaude Thornhill's band. Evans, who was employing unique voicings by adding French horns and tuba to Thornhill's instrumentations, also emphasized a diminished use of vibrato in both reeds and brass, producing a drier, ""cool"" sound. Two of Evans's arrangements, ""Boplicity"" and ""Moon Dreams,"" appear on the album. Also involved are baritone saxophonistGerry Mulligan, who contributed such outstanding tunes as ""Jeru"" and ""Venus de Milo,"" andModern Jazz QuartetpianistJohn Lewis. The result is a date that has withstood the tests of time, fashion, and Davis's own extraordinary growth as a performer. An enhanced set,The Complete Birth of the Cool, expands the original issue with previously bootlegged live recordings of Davis's nonet at the Royal Roost in New York in 1948. Although the sound quality is far from perfect, the performances are remarkable, and worth the additional expense for the serious fan.--Fred Goodman",Miles Davis

Big Pun's hit ""Still Not a Player"" is, of course, included here, and while its nasty Bronx groove sets the tone for much of the 24-song set, the big man also pays his respects to the Big Apple's other boroughs on ""Tres Leches (Triboro Trilogy"").

Fortunately, he is also a savvy student of pop music; a life-long lover of the British Invasion, particularly the Kinks and early Pink Floyd, so even his darkest mutterings come baked in a tasty, if somewhat flaky, crust. Right off the bat, Sam is sounding the alarm of complacency with some keyboard savagery in &quot;Our Happiness Is Guaranteed,&quot; a piece of lobotomized optimism about burying your head in the sand in order to achieve peace of mind. &quot;The Happy Prole&quot; is a short but devastating song about work with lines like &quot;You need the money so you've got to play it dumb/But if you play it long enough, that's just what you'll become.&quot; On &quot;Sea Shanty&quot; Sam watches the days pass like empty boats as his own vessel sails to oblivion. &quot;Life is dull/Life is gray/At its best it's just OK/But I'm happy to report/Life is also short,&quot; he acknowledges in the unaccountably zippy &quot;California.&quot; Time and again Sam warns about the ease of falling into a workaday rut, which he sees as a kind of living death; he usually refers to these people as ghosts, while those imposing the work are vampires, and the folks who accept it all without a struggle are machines. An oversimplification, or the unblinking truth? This might be too much nasty medicine if the music didn't engage so consistent.

Playing to the common themes of the season through a tale about a little angel sent to Earth to leave behind a gift, O'Neill creates a big-sounding production heavy on lead guitars and orchestral filigree. There are pieces of familiar Christmas carols and hymns and a handful of unembellished acoustic numbers to offset the brighter parts of the musical melodrama. While his singers and players are all professional sounding, O'Neill often mistakes sentiment as a grand gesture when it needs to be something less ambitious or noticeable.

Imbued with dark, swirling psychedelic licks borrowed from Jimmy Page's song book, the disc is paradoxically both more enigmatic and revealing thanPill. And whileJunkieshows that Morissette is no less stingy about revealing herself to her fans--her staccato stream-of-consciousness style is again employed to surrender her secrets and foibles a little too easily in these tales of abuse, lost love, and self-flagellation--Junkiealso makes one wonder what this musical sphinx holds back. In ""Baba"" she takes on competitive spirituality, sneering at the fashionable grasp for enlightenment. ""Would Not Come"" returns to a similar theme--taking us on a tour of her diary. ""Would Not Come"" and ""Your House"" offer the only hints of sexual innuendo. The only revenge she wreaks on an errant lover is in the percussive ""Are You Still Mad,"" this time dishing up a much subtler payback than on ""You Oughta Know."" The record's standouts, meanwhile, are ""Thank U"" and the hip-poppy ""So Pure.""

Nina Persson's slightly aching, sleepy little cutesy lead vocals sound as frictionless as rubbing two ice cubes together. Although the skies are grayer here, the one familiar musical element is their simple yet compelling rhythm structures, as evidenced in their jazz-informed drum patterns.

While the band didn't achieve stardom until their follow-up releases, 'Souvlaki' and 'Pygmalion', their trademark sound flanged guitars, light, airy vocals, and pop styling is still in evidence here. Peaking at #3 on the UK Indie Charts, 'Just For A Day' was just enough of a commercial success to push Slowdive into the mainstream. Copies, upon release, were bundled with a sticker, iterating the band s take on their album: 'Like a mind altering substance, without the risk.'

And when Ellington premiered his first long-form piece,Black, Brown and Beige, in 1943 (available on the stunningCarnegie Hall Concerts, January 1943), he was considered a dilettante. He laid the work aside until this recording, which came in early 1958--with the added oomph of gospel vocalistMahalia Jacksonon board for all the suite's vocal parts. On this expanded reissue, Columbia has added an alternate take of the entire piece as well as two unrelated tracks recorded during theBlack, Brownsessions but never before released. The suite is an expansive look, from Ellington's vantage, of course, at the evolution of African American history and culture. So there are ripples of spirited tone poetry, soaring gospel vocals from Jackson (with spare, aching piano from Ellington in spots), thundering horn-fronted swing from the band, and a consistency and unity on par with any symphonic work of the modern era. Ellington was always sensitive about this piece. After all, it showed a lot of what he held in high esteem: history, musical meditations on culture, and a full, colorful use of a band that Ellington held together for an amazingly long time. If only for Mahalia Jackson's takes on ""Come Sunday,"" by now an acknowledged standard, this set is awesome.--Andrew Bartlett",

The rest ofSurrenderhews closer to the thinner, synthesized textures of the electro revival that's swept the dance-music world. Much of the time that's just swell. The leadoff track, ""Music: Response,"" is a seamless trip back to 1985, complete with vocoderized singing and Morse-code beeps. And Sumner's ""Out of Control"" replicates the thrill of hearing the gloomy Joy Division morph into a swell synthpop band.

She layers the harmonies of her regular Union Station band, the Cox Family singers, pianist Matt Rollings, drummer Jim Keltner, and mandolinist Sam Bush to create a lush, hushed sound that's neither traditional bluegrass nor electric country-pop.

This CD combines LPs from 1962 and 1964, and they present Stitt with his working band.

The band favors clarity, straight-ahead 4/4 time, and some dexterous bop. Patterson's organ is fleet and restrained, providing Stitt with light punctuations and rock-steady bass lines. Stitt plays gorgeous alto on much of the first session, adding soaring cadenzas to original ballads like Weeden's ""Cynthia Sue."" He plays tenor throughout the later recording (contra the liner note), going from the warm and bouncing ""Misty"" to the heated ""The Eternal One.""

Though no slouch in the melody department, Sobule really shines as a deft lyricist. On songs that act as many self-contained vignettes, she captures life's little miseries and epiphanies with economy and understated humor. Though she isn't afraid to tackle wide topics (""Heroes"" reveals our icons' feet of clay with lines such as ""Heard Babe Ruth was full of malice / Lewis Carroll I'm sure did Alice""), Sobule's specialty is to focus on individuals in a way that's both sharp-witted and compassionate.

Throughout their early career as the Jazz Crusaders, they emphasized the roots side of hard bop with strong infusions of funk, soul, and gospel, making them naturals for the rise of fusion. They reached the peak of their success in the 1970s on a series of GRP records that provides the sources for thisFinest Hourcollection. The band had become increasingly electronic and studio-oriented, and the result is instrumental R&B; that effectively mixes Felder's powerful tenor with Hooper's strong rhythmic grooves and Sample's layered keyboards and arrangements. The early tracks get additional solo contributions from trombonist Wayne Henderson and guitarist Larry Cramer, while Randy Crawford's vocal adds another dimension to the extended ""Street Beat.""

It takes someone who learned from the style's master--that would beRobert Johnson, in case you're wondering--to explore the music's length and breadth, and that someone is Robert Lockwood Jr. That's why, even though he covers some of the hoariest chestnuts the Delta blues has to offer--yep, there's ""Dust My Broom,"" and yep, there's ""Love in Vain,"" and ""Ramblin' on My Mind,"" not to mentionLightnin' Hopkins's ""C.C.

Jenkins used choral vocals similar toEnya's, but spiked with a language of the imagination (merging African and Latin phonemes) and stoked by Jenkins's pastoral arrangements. Never wholly original--Lisa Gerrardand Elizabeth Fraser had already worked out fantasy vocal designs and the 1960s African mass ""Missa Luba"" effected a similar choral/African/Latin sound--Adiemus nevertheless found a new take on English composers' penchant for choirs. However, after six years and four albums mining this vein, Jenkins's sound rings more hollow with each recording.The Eternal Knotis drawn from Jenkins's soundtrack to a BBC  documentary calledThe Celts. You might recall that Enya also evolved her sound in the late 1980s doing a soundtrack for another documentary calledThe Celts. Taking his titles from the Celtic legends that populate the documentary, Jenkins orchestrates cinematic landscapes full of swelling crescendos and dynamic cadences. Less oppressive than the heavily orchestratedAdiemus II,The Eternal Knotstill wears thin. He castsMiriam Stockley's voice into a boys-choir register, turning her staccato phonemes into incessant prattle. But when she's in her warmer middle range, her layered voice is enveloping. Despite the theme of the album, Celtic music is only used as an occasional touchstone, with uilleann piperDavy Spillane, a few bodhran-style percussion grooves, and harpist Catrin Finch providing some relief from Jenkins's string-laden classical pretensions.--John Diliberto",

This is the year of the Rebels!Forming River City Rebels in a small town outside of Burlington, VT when the majority of the members were still in high school, they have spent the past three years on Victory Records building one of the most diverse and solid followings of any band in the punk scene. They were quickly picked in the Spring of 2000 when founder of Victory Records, Tony Brummel discovered this rag-tag band of punk rock misfits. Brummel took a chance on the seven young men and their raucous old-school punk style. The Rebels quickly made a name for themselves in punk circles around the world with the release of their first two records, ""Racism, Religion and War"" and ""Playing to Live, Living to Play."" After much maturing and a few line-up changes the Rebels have found a combination that works. GG Allin-esque front man, Dan O'Day, known to many as the ""Bopper"", leads The Rebels' rebellion. His provocative stage presence and no holds barred attitude attracts a rowdy slew of followers. He is backed by an unruly bunch, with Eric Schmidt on drums and Chris Jukosky on bass forming the backbone of the battalion. On guitar, Chris Hamm explodes with guttural rock n' roll guitar riffs while Rylan Perry and Brandon Rainer finish the audience off with their airborne sniper horn attack.River City Rebels are evidence that punk is not dead. ""No Good, No Time, No Pride"" will prove to be one of the most inspiring records of the punk revival with their fist pumping choruses and sing-a-longs around every corner. ""No Good, No Time, No Pride"" showcases the Rebels' unique ability to create infectious punk anthems with powerful, politically aware lyrics. The Rebels give a much-needed kick in the pants to the punk scene, combining the insolence of the Sex Pistols and unforgettable sing-a-longs reminiscent of The Clash.River City Rebels' crass horn laden punk rock has helped land them on some of the biggest punk rock tours around including the legendary Dead Kennedys and two of horn punk&#xD5;s biggest acts, Less Than Jake and Voodoo Glow Skulls. The Rebels will kick off ""No Good, No Time, No Pride"" with dates with Roget Miret and the Disasters, Mustard Plug and Tsunami Bomb. They will tackle 2002 and charge their way into 2003 with one of the most promising new albums in punk rock. River City Rebels are on their way to making history.",

The first tip-off that Kelly has left the spirit world to concentrate on  nookie is the CD title, which refers back to his mid-'90s smash12 Play.  Back then, Kelly made his name with a take-no-prisoners (if somewhat obvious)  sensuality. Yet now this loveman sounds conflicted and ill at ease. He might  offer to ""Strip for You,"" he might lay claim for a girl who's ""Like a Real Freak,"" he might even promise his lady ""The Greatest Sex,"" but his manner is so tentative and so self-reflective it makes one wonder how hot the loving could really be. Kelly has been expanding his creative repertoire over the course of his past two CDs, and his latest motif is a sort of stream-of-consciousness style that constantly returns to the main thrust of the argument: a circular groove. At its best (the triumphant ""I Wish""), this style is emotional and emphatic. At its worst, or when Kelly insists on using it over and over, it's the musical equivalent of having a drunk poke you in the arm repeatedly to make his point. On ""Fiesta,"" Kelly literally builds a song out of this annoying rhythmic tic, and it's like he's on a treadmill, never getting anywhere.TP-2.comis raw and  romantic, but it becomes too redundant to truly sustain the passion.--Amy Linden",R.

From Brett Scallions's heart-wrenching vocal performance on the CD's first single, ""Hemorrhage (in My Hands),"" with its mournful reflections to the ""Shimmer""-like ""Slow,"" the bleak, dark temperament that characterizedSunburnis continued. Even seemingly upbeat moments are buried deep in paranoia (""Knives"") or leave a bitter taste (""Solace"").

Erykah Badu's voice was always her main attraction--its unique sound has been compared toBillie HolidayandChaka Khan. Here, it's her skill with that voice that shines. Badu shapes her instrument to suit her material (all of it written or cowritten by her). A full range is represented: On faster, danceable tracks like ""Penitentiary Philosophy"" and ""Booty,"" she sounds gritty and funky. On softer, more introspective tracks, like ""A.D. 2000"" and the single ""Bag Lady,"" she shows amazing restraint, letting her voice travel lightly over the notes, allowing the songs' emotions to guide her performance. The high point of the disc is Badu's duet with Stephen Marley, ""In Love with You,"" easily the sweetest, truest love song of the year.

WithBorn to Fly, her third album, Evans continues her descent from the neo-traditional high ground and her move uptown. She makes it clear she's also listened quite a bit to the likes ofTrisha YearwoodandBruce Hornsby, whose ""Every Little Kiss"" she ably covers here. On the exuberant title tune and on fine country-pop ballads like ""I Could Not Ask for More"" and the lovely ""Saints and Angels,"" Evans proves she can just as sweetly and deftly patrol the uptown territory as she can the down-home highlands, which she revisits on the steel guitar-adorned weeper ""I Learned That from You.""

Trumpeter Dorham is joined by tenor saxophonistHank Mobley, once his frontline partner in the originalJazz Messengers, the underrated pianistKenny Drew, and one of the finest rhythm teams ever to play jazz, bassistPaul Chambersand drummerPhilly Joe Jones. The immediate distinguishing mark is Dorham's writing. Though only his ""Blue Bossa"" has become a jazz standard, he was a serious writer, not someone who merely dashed off casual heads. His tunes here have substance, like the sparkling blues ""Buffalo"" and the evocative, modal ""Sunset"" with its sudden piano punctuations under the theme. The title tune contrasts eerie dissonance with a snapping bop line, and ""Sunrise in Mexico"" orchestrates bass and piano into the theme. The concluding ""Dorham's Epitaph,"" at little more than a minute, has an unadorned majesty. Dorham and Mobley shared a forceful lyricism and a rare camaraderie, and there are moments in ""Sunrise"" when Dorham's half-valves even suggest Mobley's round tenor sound. Jones makes a special contribution, adding a propulsive spark and a constant stream of detail.--Stuart Broomer",

He might be crude, he might be loud (hell is he loud) and his flow might makeDMX'scanine fixations seem like subtle artistry. But be he rapping or be he semi-sing-songy vocalizing, Ja Rule's brand of rough-and-tough love gets under your skin. OK, it also starts to get on your nerves, but what Mr. Rule lacks in finesse he makes up for in intensity. Musically, his sophomore CD, with its stutter-stop break-point beats and its rich, resonant sound is nothing to ignore. Which must be why the first single, the off-kilter ""Between Me and You,"" is so successful. This isn't groundbreaking or even significant stuff, but Ja's raspy roar has a certain appeal. While said appeal is geared towards men in the joint and the women who stand by them, you can't hate on a guy for trying, in his own way, to show a little love in this cold, cold world.--Amy Linden",MUSIC

Rediscovered during the 1960s folk boom after last recording in the late 1920s, Hurt cut the three albums compiled here when he was in his early 70s. His conversational phrasing sounds as natural as breathing, while his ragtime-tinged fingerpicking on acoustic guitar reveals more complexity the closer you listen. Beyond blues classics like ""Candy Man"" (the sly sensualist wasn't referring to lollipops), Hurt's range encompasses everything from folkish narratives (""Talking Casey,"" ""Spike Driver Blues"") to Southern spirituals (""Nearer My God to Thee,"" ""Farther Along"").

Grappelli's most famous collaboration was of course his six-year stint in the 1930s with the Gypsy guitaristDjango Reinhardt, but it wasn't until he started playing with pianists like Peterson that he really developed into a world-class soloist. Peterson's lush, full chords suit Grappelli's unabashedly romantic style perfectly, and on ballads like ""My One and Only Love"" his fiddling is lyrical, but with a melancholy depth that keeps it from descending into mere prettiness. The other musicians include bassist Niels-Henning &#xD8;rsted Pedersen and drummer Kenny Clark, whose supple, swinging rhythm gives the solos a gentle lift while driving them forward. Peterson and Grappelli were both old pros when they made this record, but the charm of tracks like ""Thou Swell"" and ""Makin' Whoopee"" show that even after decades in the business, they hadn't lost the ability to surprise and delight each other.--Michael Simmons",

This is an album that is consistent; neither the low nor the high points stray far from the middle.  The finest moments are found at the beginning and end of the album.

Released in early 1978,Waylon & Williewas a celebration of their triumphant revolution against Nashville's constraints. By then, the war had already been won; each had wrested artistic freedom from the labels and subsequently delivered chart-topping solo albums and singles. The 1976 compilationWanted! The Outlawsproved to be the ultimate victory--becoming the first country album to go platinum--so by the time they put this album together, Waylon and Willie were at the peak of their commercial powers. There's plenty of great music here as well among the five duets and six solo tracks (three by each), mostly new tunes with some older material thrown in. Not all of it is essential, and Willie's own guitar is nowhere to be found, allowing Jennings's Waylors to deftly handle the musical accompaniment. Still, the cultural importance ofWaylon & Willie--it soared to No. 1 on the country chart, stayed there for three months, and went double platinum--makes it a valuable memento of ""outlaw"" country's heyday and of modern country history.--Marc Greilsamer",

""It has simplified everything for me, and it has opened a lot of doors."" It doesn't take a detective to crack this thinly veiled statement of intent; when Steve Malkmus, boyish frontman of lo-fi trailblazersPavementfinally jumped ship from his mother-band in 2000, reasons were thin on the ground. Perhaps, then, this is the spirit ofStephen Malkmus: the king of the cryptic couplet freed from his 11-year yoke and embarking on an ultimate loosening-up exercise--the eponymous debut solo album. Odd, though, that it should sound exactly like Pavement.Stephen Malkmusis a close relative ofTerror Twilight--a neatly polished showcase of shambolic art-pop, with a grinning, brotherly Malkmus dropping wisecracks every inch of the way. It sure sounds like he is having fun, indulging in vicious pirate fantasies on ""The Hook,"" claiming to be ""the king of Siam"" on ""Jo Jo's Jacket""--and isn't that him yodelling in the background on ""Phantasies""? The only problem is, there is precious little of the disarming tenderness that once made Pavement's quirkier rough edges so endearing.

By 2001, most people had probably forgotten that they still existed (their previous album,Orblivion, was released three years before that, an eternity in the world of modern electronic music). Some music critics even questioned the band's relevance in the 21st century. In an age of sophisticated chill-out tastes, could the Orb still cut it? From the evidence onCydonia, the answer is a resounding yes. The album sees mainman Alex Paterson fusing rolling dub bass lines and classic Orb ambiance with crisp breaks, shimmering synths, and off-kilter electronics. There are spacious vocal numbers (singers Aki and Nina Walsh sound remarkably likeBj&ouml;rk); short, dub-house instrumentals; and spooky, other-worldly drum & bass pieces. It's like rave-era ambient house given a new millennium makeover. It's hardly revolutionary, but that's not the point.

They go around impersonating aliens and robots in their interviews, they put records out only once every three years, and they make music that evokes a million other artists--while not really sounding like any of them. The keyboard noodlings of Jean-Michel Jarre are in there somewhere, along with the otherworldly imagery and giant hooks of '70s rock icons like Boston or even Electric Light Orchestra. There are dashes of 1999-era Prince and oodles of new wave and disco cheese, from Harold Faltermeyer and Gary Numan to the Bee Gees, all set off with efficient house beats. So how have they managed to position themselves as electronic music's next great crossover artists? On Discovery, the follow-up to the 1998 worldwide smash Homework, the answer is obvious: they have no shame, and they know how to make us dance. Starting off with the irresistibly hummable ""One More Time,"" the record blows through a head-spinning array of styles and samples, creating a pop-culture stew of funky loops and dance-floor anthems. ""Aerodynamic"" eschews breakbeats for an Yngwie Malmsteen-ish guitar interlude that somehow ends up meshing in a crazy blend of stomping bass lines and hyped-up harmonics. ""Digital Love"" starts off silly and gets sillier, but the monosyllabic lyrics lull the senses just right, allowing the song's summery groove to grab hold with authority. ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" is a resounding standout amidst the retro/Vocoder deluge that transpired after Cher's Believe turned the kitchy disco device into a worldwide pop music trend, spinning a clever groove around an ever-escalating string of computerized seduction. Everywhere on the record, gigantic beats are dropped with pinpoint precision, giving songs a momentum that transforms repetitive melodies into sudden revelations.",VIRGIN

Where that session was a lean, live cooker that cemented the trio's appeal to the acid-jazz and jam-band crowd,Doin' Somethingreaps the rewards of time spent in the studio--there are overdubs and, more importantly, an ambitious, varied overall vision. Rather than just rattling off a dozen jams based on a single line, the tunes here are actual songs with memorable melodies that draw upon hip-hop, soul, funk, and pop to go along with the rump-shaking jazz grooves. Furthering the funk foundation, the trio--guitarist Eric Krasno and brothers Neal and Alan Evans on organ and drums, respectively, also brought inJames Brown-veteran trombonistFred Wesleyto lead a four-piece brass section (and contribute horn arrangements) on a few tracks.

He  sums it up in ""Lick a Shot"": ""I'm a MC/ I don't think/ Like you rap  superstars'll think."" Meaning: yeah, he's got a formula, but it's  uniquely his own. Whether you'll dig it this time around is the  question, and the answer comes down to personal taste. Do you like  lyrically intricate songs? Do you like smoking hot beats (compliments  of the Green Eyed Bandit himself,Erick Sermon)? Are  you into extreme misogyny and violence? How's your tolerance for songs  about trying to get into nightclubs? All of this can be found inMalpractice. The album is creative, often clever, and filled  with violent, nightmarish imagery. Even the insert artwork is  unsettling. This won't be an issue to diehard Redman fans who've  eagerly awaited this long-delayed release.

""Don't be like me nigga, be yourself,"" he advises  the corrupted minor. Cue ""I'm a Thug,"" where an angelic chorus of  streetwalkers sympathizes sweetly as the slurry MC drawls an  affirmation of his ghetto identity.

If you don't treat your kids right, they're gonna up and start an alt-metal band to share the angst you've brought on them with the world. After all, who needs therapy when you've got a million kids hearing your pain on MTV? Staind has never been a band to gloss over personal issues. They've given their albums names likeTormentandDysfunction, and their lyrics delve deep into singer Aaron Lewis' difficult past. Contrary to the title, Staind's third release,Break the Cycle, sticks with the tormented cycle, covering the same themes of heartbreak, self-doubt, and broken homes.Lewis has almost three decades of personal material to mine, and as familiar as his issues are,Break the Cyclestill feels like a new, honest look into difficulties that can hit people across the board. ""Waste,"" a song written to a fan who committed suicide, is particularly poignant as it grabbles with Lewis's empathy and anger for a boy he's never met. ""Outside"" is another album standout. It's a slower, partially acoustic number that builds on its own emotion. The songs onBreak the Cycleare drenched in melancholy melodies and slow, heavy riffs typical of the sensitive side of the alt-rock genre. Lewis sometimes breaks out into either a hearty yell or a throaty gurgle that sounds like the devil vomiting (""Can't Believe""), but the best songs keep his passion a little more controlled. You've probably heard rock likeBreak the Cyclepiping from mainstream radio stations already, but Lewis's ability to turn his breakdowns into his art should capture a new round of fans happy to find kindred spirits in the band.--Jennifer Maerz",Staind

However,Kiss tha Game Goodbyeexposes Jada's lyrical limitations rather than magnifying his talents.  The album kicks off with the keyboard-heavy Swizz Beatz-produced  ""Jada's Got a Gun."" The hook is sung to the tune ofAerosmith's  ""Janie's Got a Gun,"" but it's not so much the unoriginal chorus that  grates on the nerves as it is Jadakiss's narrow gun-centric lyrical  focus as he brags: ""I got a gun wit' 200 shots / I'm the reason you  moved your family to a whole new other block."" Students of the rap game  will get a healthy sampling of Jada's unparalleled diction and punch  lines that flow over great beats supplied by A-list producers (Timbaland,  Neptunes, and DJ Premier in this case). There's little diversity in his  lyrics as he boasts in ""I'm a Gangsta"" ""my bullets is bisexual cuz they  hit niggas and bitches,"" while in theSnoop Dogg-aided  ""Cruisin'"" where he threatens to spread ""bullets around like chicken  pox."" ""We Gonna Make It"" is an obvious chartbuster despite utilizing  the same music asRas Kassdid in the  ""Home Sweet Home"" underground headbanger. Likewise, the album is worth  purchasing to peep theBeanie Sigeldis  track ""Un-Hunh!"" However, some will tire of Jada's gun-talk and  serial-philandering routine.

McCain has since developed a strong following for his own brand of unvarnished heartland rock. With his fourth album, the South Carolina native returns to the familiar landscape ofMisguided RosesandMessenger, with his sublimely infectious melodies and anthemic choruses inhabiting the territory once claimed by theDoobie BrothersandLee Michaelsin the '70s. While first hailed as an acoustic balladeer, McCain and his band have expanded their parameters, ably careening from genre to genre with gusto. They are equally at home whipping up some thunder on a barn burner such as ""Get Out of This Town"" as they are getting sentimental with ""Write Me a Song"" and the graceful ""Hearts Fall,"" both of which feature vocals by McCain palShawn Colvin. This latest offering is less polished than earlier works, perhaps due to the fact that it was coproduced by the band andNeil Youngengineer Greg Archilla.

It's Burnside in the raw, playing solo on acoustic guitar as he did for his neighbors for most of his early career--when farming was still his profession. Burnside reprised ""Miss Maybelle,"" ""Mellow Peaches,"" ""Poor Boy,"" ""Jumper on the Line,"" and  others among these songs on his more recent albums for Fat Possum Records, but these early versions capture his driving blend of one-chord rhythm with lightning decorations of slide and melody already fully developed.If anything, Burnside's guitar playing has slowed over the years, but it's taken on gravity as it's grown more spare, just as his voice--high and limber here--has added character with the imperfections of age. Burnside, who turned 73 in November, is also a more idiosyncratic musician now. Nonetheless, it's a  pleasure to hear him doing numbers like ""Bad Luck and Trouble"" nearly 20  years ago, fusing the influences ofJohn Lee HookerandFred McDowellinto  the potent style that's made him one of today's premier practitioners of old-time rural blues.--Ted Drozdowski",

In fact, one could say they're almost as green asGreen Day, especially on ""Knockdown Dragout."" At their best, Weezer show such boundless energy and gleeful aplomb that you'd swear you were listening to a lostBadfingeralbum.

Throughout the band's shoe-gazer, emo, and punk-pop periods, and now as it settles into an everything-old-is-new-again space with an '80s-influenced retro-pop album, listening to the band's music has been a game of spotting the musical allusion. Is that aPixiescover? A rareMy Bloody ValentineB-side? Singer-songwriter Jason Martin has an unusual ability to pull from the pop canon while missing most of the pitfalls of such referencing. This time he rifles through hisBreakfast Club-era albums to create 10 swirly, orchestral, mid- to down-tempo songs that recall nothing so much as early MTV, or the music that played at public swimming pools and skating rinks circa 1985. Martin's vocals are high in the mix, turning soaring violin, harp, and keyboard into a whispery texture when he sings. A testament to the songs' power comes when he stops singing, and skillfully focuses attention on the music. Noticing every crescendo, bridge, and chorus? Of course you are.

This is the year of the Rebels!Forming River City Rebels in a small town outside of Burlington, VT when the majority of the members were still in high school, they have spent the past three years on Victory Records building one of the most diverse and solid followings of any band in the punk scene. They were quickly picked in the Spring of 2000 when founder of Victory Records, Tony Brummel discovered this rag-tag band of punk rock misfits. Brummel took a chance on the seven young men and their raucous old-school punk style. The Rebels quickly made a name for themselves in punk circles around the world with the release of their first two records, ""Racism, Religion and War"" and ""Playing to Live, Living to Play."" After much maturing and a few line-up changes the Rebels have found a combination that works. GG Allin-esque front man, Dan O'Day, known to many as the ""Bopper"", leads The Rebels' rebellion. His provocative stage presence and no holds barred attitude attracts a rowdy slew of followers. He is backed by an unruly bunch, with Eric Schmidt on drums and Chris Jukosky on bass forming the backbone of the battalion. On guitar, Chris Hamm explodes with guttural rock n' roll guitar riffs while Rylan Perry and Brandon Rainer finish the audience off with their airborne sniper horn attack.River City Rebels are evidence that punk is not dead. ""No Good, No Time, No Pride"" will prove to be one of the most inspiring records of the punk revival with their fist pumping choruses and sing-a-longs around every corner. ""No Good, No Time, No Pride"" showcases the Rebels' unique ability to create infectious punk anthems with powerful, politically aware lyrics. The Rebels give a much-needed kick in the pants to the punk scene, combining the insolence of the Sex Pistols and unforgettable sing-a-longs reminiscent of The Clash.River City Rebels' crass horn laden punk rock has helped land them on some of the biggest punk rock tours around including the legendary Dead Kennedys and two of horn punk&#xD5;s biggest acts, Less Than Jake and Voodoo Glow Skulls. The Rebels will kick off ""No Good, No Time, No Pride"" with dates with Roget Miret and the Disasters, Mustard Plug and Tsunami Bomb.

To his credit, Thornton, withMarty Stuartproducing, bypasses radio formula for a different kind of connection with his listener, veering from lengthy spoken verse to retro hillbilly deluxe. But does the listener want to hear what he has to say? In the opening song, ""Dark and Mad,"" Thornton seems to telegraph the brooding danger of his most famous film role. Yet almost immediately he gets lost in ruminations so personal that he almost forgets there's an audience waiting to be involved. Past the kinky charm of ""Forever,"" a bluesy, one-way telephone conversation in which he tells his main squeeze he's wearing the feathered pink panties she left in his car, there's a love song to his wife that's 180 degrees from passion, a revamped salute to John F. Kennedy, and a nine-and-a-half-minute piece of theatrical Southern gothic about witnessing a disturbing sexual encounter as a child. It's a weird trip, and totally unfocused, as if he just recorded whatever came into his head.

The concept is fairly unique--althoughLiz Phairhad a similar idea with 1993'sExile in Guyville. But while Phair fashioned original lyrics in response to the Rolling Stones'Exile on Main Street, Amos sticks with the script when reciting lyrics from acts as diverse as theVelvet Underground,Depeche Mode,Neil Young,Tom Waits, andSlayer. She transforms the material, though, by singing in a pained tone, weighing the lyrics with heavy emotion and stripping most of the songs down to their simplest elements--often just a string section, a drum machine or a piano, leaving the original music almost unrecognizable. The most poignant of these tracks is definitely her cover ofEminem's ""97' Bonnie and Clyde."" The first-person story of a man dumping his lover's dead body takes on an ugly sickness and brutality with Amos's almost-whispered narration. As with most of these songs, Amos removes the pop fa&ccedil;ade and leaves the listener with a stark picture of the message behind the lyrics--whether that message concerns violence or male identity--in a statement both subtly political and stunningly beautiful.--Jennifer Maerz","AMOS,TORI"

The 73-year-old is joined by his usual jukehouse band, his drummer and grandson Cedric Burnside and guitarist Kenny Brown, who blow sparks behind Burnside's rich honey-and-molasses voice and chunky six-string affirmations. Every time Burnside hits a note, it's a reminder of both how vital an interpreter of the hypnotic style developed byFred McDowellhe remains and how true electric country blues still sounds in its unvarnished state.There's an emotional resonance that runs through this music like blood, especially when Burnside plays solo. His all-alone performances of ""Walking Blues"" and ""Bad Luck and Trouble"" reveal every nuance of his caw-to-keen singing and the sweet way his slide slices right to the emotional core of a lyric. Burnside's off-color jokes and song-ending punctuations (mostly buoyant ""Well, well, wells"") also give an inkling of the wild-ass grandpa charisma that makes him so appealing on stage. Burnside has, however, delivered better concerts. At times these tempos seem rushed, which sacrifices some of the subtleties of his vocalizing. But Brown unleashes a rabid slide solo on ""Snakedrive"" that shoots the tune skyward, and he and Cedric display relentless energy and thrust.

Gratifyingly, it's also by turns mature, musically restless, and  personally reflective--and ultimately an album that stands alongsideTug of WarandFlowers in the Dirtas one of his best solo efforts. Informed by David Kahne's warmly low-key yet  gritty production and McCartney's still formidable pipes, there are few traces  of the candy-ass pop and precious sentiment that have long vexed fans and  detractors alike. Even the jaunty title track (with its ""1-2-3-4-5"" chorus  recalling the Fabs' ""All Together Now"") seems infused with a welcome edge.  There's a renewed sense of emotional connection throughout, reflected in efforts  that seem to address his own personal tragedy (the unsettled ""Lonely Road,""  melancholy ""From a Lover to a Friend,"" and plaintive ""I Do""). And then there's  the quietly haunting ""She's Given Up Talking"" and the bluesy irony of ""Back in  the Sunshine Again"" and ""Rinse the Raindrops.""

In each ofThe Green Fury's 13 tracks, Pond's lyrics fill a ghostly narrative with pointillist daubs of emotion, creating a dreamy series of images that at times recalls Peter Gabriel's albums from the early MTV era, and at other times resolve into lush, rolling soundscapes. Pond's melancholy vocals lead 12 other instruments, veering from soothing and lullaby-like to soulful and urgent from one song to the next.

It's tempting to say that aboutBarry Manilow, an artist whose stubborn, quarter-century dedication to old-fashioned song craft and musical melodrama has earned him few critical praises but a loyal worldwide following in the millions. When a cult of 20-something would-be lounge lizards tried to cash in on Manilow's shtick in the 1990s, they distanced themselves from its emotional potency with telling dollops of irony and retro-hip cynicism--anything to keep from looking too sincere. This album serves up the high points of Manilow's long, successful career, rightly focusing on the long string of '70s hits that built both his legend and record label. They're a body of songs whose solid craftsmanship is undeniable, but it's Manilow's sincerity that crucially sells them--indeed, he didn't write ""I Write the Songs,"" but who could doubt him? It's an odd tribute that much here--""Mandy,"" ""Looks Like We Made It,"" ""Copacabana,"" et. al.--has become the palette for a popular entertainment spectrum that somehow encompasses endless hotel piano bars on one flank and TV sketch-com parody on the other. Good to remember that kitsch, by definition, requires a deep and lasting impact on the culture. Manilow hasn't just embraced the ""K"" word; he's reveled in it with a smile--how could one frown through ""Bandstand Boogie"" and ""Copa"" anyway?--and elevated it to something approaching the transcendental through his sheer, joyous force of will. And if his latter work has been unabashedly nostalgic, how could anyone be surprised?--Jerry McCulley",Ultimate

The horn-section-goosing opening track ""I Do"" is pure Stax with a little '70s-era thwacketa-thwacketa guitar menace; ""Thunderhead Hawkins,"" with its drawling vocals and slide guitar, is pure Arkansas front-porch boogaloo; ""Memphis Soul Song"" is just that; ""To Think I Used to Love You"" could have been torn from theMerle Haggardsongbook; and ""Keep It Comin'"" is fierce hip-hop. A ballad, ""Letter to My Daughters,"" is sweet if unnervingly sappy (thinkBob Carlisle's ""Butterfly Kisses""), whileSugar Ray's Mark McGrath adds negligible freight to the title track. ButNo Stranger to Shame's finest moment is a borrowed one--a faithful cover ofDobie Gray's inspirational rock & roll love letter, ""Drift Away."" An underappreciated classic from the early '70s, ""Drift Away"" still sounds relevant, and Kracker's soulful version--featuring Gray himself--will do much to spotlight that comforting old chestnut.--Kim Hughes",Wea2

With a sexy yet imperfect swagger, they come on like calculating outsiders bent on forcing their way in.

The perplexing part of this equation is these once and future rude boys from Boston have never sounded better or more ready for prime time; their metal-ska punk has been honed to a fine, serrated edge, with much of the furious posturing of years past gone. Always a tight and flashy band, this time out the Bosstones have spent considerable time crafting a set of dynamic lyrics that are cinematic in scope, with a barely hidden moral center that shines brightly. Most of the tunes are small narrative slices of life that might have been ""ripped from the headlines,"" like the gritty, ska-infused ""Mr. Moran,"" based on the life of Mafia turncoat Salvatore ""Sammy the Bull"" Bravano, who testified against mob boss John Gotti. The dark subject matter is skillfully integrated in the almost childlike sing-song delivery, with the occasional explosive expletive as reality check and a nod to subtle irony. Others tunes are cautionary tales, like the hard-charging ""You Can't Win,"" which warns that there are different rules for normal folks and rich types: ""They're wide awake while you're still in bed / They count the money while you count the sheep."" They return again to this theme of the eternal war of ""us versus them"" on the acerbic ""Punch Line,"" finally settling all questions of personal inequity on the poetic and uplifting ""Everybody's Better."" This standout song could have ambled off a Jamaican beach, with its casual rhythms and breezy horn section, but once again behind the deceptively simple melody lies profundity: ""To be king, you don't need a castle&#x85; A true king rules without a crown."" On this album, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones truly earn their second modifier and show themselves more than able rule all that they survey.--Jaan Uhelszki",

But it's that very punk rock-gone-underground-dance spirit that separates Swayzak's latest from the more rudimentary electro-art pack. ""I Dance Alone"" goes even deeper into the lonely trench-coat crowd of the late '80s, with Detroit godhead Adult.'s Nicola Kuperus laying down the law on the mic. Old-school goths will be crying beneath their capes for this baby. ""The Punk Era"" remembers the early days of Factory records and writing poetry to New Order'sPower, Corruption and Lies. ""Take My Hand"" re-runs nostalgic reels of Depeche Mode when Vince Clarke was still in the band. But amid all of this looking back to move forward, new ideas are rapidly gestating.Mining the classic tech-house (as derived from the Kraftwerk theorem) blueprint for the last track, ""Ping Pong,"" Swayzak's undeniable might has the potential of being a vital bridge in the gap between the more cerebral dance floors, electro-clash hype and the seeds of a pop-culture paradigm shift.

On ""Happy at Last,"" one of the tracks from the Atlanta native's second album, he admits, ""I sound like Michael Stipe / I dream like Carl Jung,"" beating to the punch those detractors who complain that his idiosyncratic adenoidal singing sounds astonishingly like those of theR.E.M.frontman. Whether the startling similarity is an accident of geography or design is immaterial, since it's Joplin's wry self-deprecating lyrics, clever wordplay, and brainy illusions that make you take notice. ""I'm not the only cowboy in this one-horse metaphor,"" he sings in the anxious ""I Am Not the Only Cowboy,"" adding, ""I am not the only Caufield catching more than kids."" In the space of a single song, Joplin's canny self-awareness curdles into self-absorption; in fact, it would be safe to say he identifies rather closely with J.D. Salinger's most famous character. Like Holden, Joplin not only has a fascination with death--references to the great equalizer are threaded through most of the 13 songs--but he also has quite a problem with growing up. ""Time just hates me, that's why it made me an adult,"" he whines on ""Must Be You,"" returning to a similar theme in ""Siddharthas of Suburbia,"" when he decries, ""The future is a stereo that eats your favorite tapes / The soundtrack to your youth cannot be replaced."" But despite his raging neuroses, Joplin is a zany storyteller, whether he's writing a love song to his trampoline (where he admits he comes up with some of his best ideas for songs) or reinterpreting the Bible on ""The Future That Was."" Josh Joplin is a talent to watch.--Jaan Uhelszki",Artemis

But it's those very activities that arguably inspired the Sea and Cake to record this vibrant, often sublime collection. Colored by a seductive cocktail of influences that includes Brazilian jazz and arty kraut-rock textures, with singer-songwriterSam Prekop's breathy vocals a much less precious take onMichael Franks's, the 10 tracks onOne Bedroomare a masterly exercise in restraint, subtle sophistication, and melodic playfulness. Prekop's &#xFC;ber-cool delivery takes center stage throughout, whether it's playing against jazzy, electronic-infused backdrops on standouts like the dreamy ""Left Side Clouded,"" the nervous rhythms of ""Hotel Tell,"" the breezy ambitions of ""Shoulder Length,"" or the spare beauty of the title track.

On this CD, with her  longtime bassistMarc Johnsonand drummersJoey Baronand Paulo Braga, Elias's elegant and elastic piano springs from the influences ofHerbie Hancock,Art Tatum, and the European classical masters. That mix is heard beautifully on the hushed-toned ""Apareceu"" and the moving ""September"" and ""October,"" which feature Randy Brecker on flugelhorn and muted trumpet. ""Manhattan"" is a soulful tribute to Elias's adopted hometown, and her birth country is represented by the bouncy bossa nova-choro ""Luar."" Along with her spare piano solos and her breathy vocals, both in English and Portuguese, Elias drops some cool, club-ready,  electronica-style remixes of the title track and ""Balance,"" courtesy of the Brazilian DJ collective Bossacucanova.

Two years later, David has slogged through the minefields of sudden stardom and lived to sing about it, which he does with stylist aplomb onSlicker Than Your Average. David has sacrificed some of his milk-fed innocence but none of his braggadocio, as the title attests. His sound is harder, more anxious, and much more suitable for clubs than the soft, breezy nu-soul of his first outing. This time, he deals with darker matters, such as the press's relentless scrutiny (""Why are you watching me when you should just let me be Craig"") and the dangerous pitfalls of fame (""I'm not the man I used to be""). He'snotthe man he used to be, for fame seems to have shaken the scales from his eyes. This one-time wide-eyed romantic no longer pines for his perfect love, instead casting a jaundiced eye at the women vying for his attention on ""What's Your Flava.""

Conceptually, ""Release Date,"" a provocative first-person look at what goes through a prison inmate's mind just before being discharged, showcases what you'd come to expect from an Xzibit track: rugged beats, even nastier rhymes. However, the track's production by the much-f&#xEA;ted Rockwilder is an afterthought. So clearly, when the X-man sticks to his growling flows over purist beats by DJ Premier (""What a Mess""), or with the similarly grittyM.O.P.(""BK to LA""), the results are splendid. But with Dre and company on board, X seems to lose some of his focus and organic luster.

Appropriately,Riot Actis built on thematic pillars--love, death, politics--and fueled by dense, uncompromising power chords. It takes yet another step away from the courteous tones of the band's cornerstone LPs,TenandVs, and proudly flaunts egotism (""I know I was born and I know that I'll die/ The in-between is mine,"" Eddie Vedder sings on ""I Am Mine"") and a dark underbelly (""Green Disease""). But it's far from insufferable: If any band can make self-obsession sound hospitable, it's Pearl Jam.

That said, ""Diamonds on the Inside"" is painted with the same brush thatBob Dylanused on ""I Shall Be Released,"" but Harper adds his own Biblical aphorisms to make the song his own. Most of the songs display Harper's growth as a poet, as he ponders the dualities of life and love in tunes like the disturbing ""Touch from Your Lust"" and the disquietingly lyrical ""Amen Omen."" Harper is compelled to sing what is in his heart and to do what he can to make the world a better place. Witness theMarley-like ""With My Own Two Hands.""

Where Malkmus's self-titled debut accentuated his flirtatious, pop-friendly inclinations,Pig Libis gnarlier and more expansive.

The two most obvious influences on spindly, febrile epics like ""1% of One"" and ""Witch Mountain Bridge"" areTelevisionandFairport Convention; Malkmus is particularly proficient at highlighting the affinities between New York art punk and British folk-rock through his notably improved guitar playing.

Debut single ""We Don't Care"" was a menacing musical manifesto; a loud, laddish, bass-heavy mash-up of house, dub, hip-hop, and bassline garage that seemed to stick two-fingers up at perceived musical boundaries. Clearly, these guys mean business. The duo's much-heralded debut long player,Ego War, expands this manifesto further, taking in elements of ska, punk, and electro. It's pretty good, too, mixing genuinely abrasive floor-fillers--""Real Life,"" ""The Snow"" (a disco-punk-house mash-up of epic proportions), with more contemplative numbers (such as the wistful ""Veteran"" or ""100 Million""). Sometimes they come on like theSpecialsjamming withBasement Jaxxwith theStreets' Mike Skinner on vocals, at other times like ""Magnificent Seven""-eraClashwith Rob ""Stereo MC's"" Birch on vocals; only dirtier.

Many of the 12 songs on his fourth album with the Fernandos,The Secret Sun, are built on a foundation of acoustic guitar--his and that of ex-Lounge LizardTony Scherr (who also plays electric guitar throughout). These two are abetted by a particularly supple rhythm section--bassist Tim Luntzel and Kenny Wollesen (Tom Waits,Bill Frisell). Similar to Jones's work, there's an understated elegance to these songs, and the band is clearly comfortable with bluesy pop, country rock, singer-songwriter ballads, and even traditional folk (the album's one cover, ""Roberta""). Jones appears on one song, the duet ""What Makes You,"" but it&#x92;s not even the best song here. That honor could go to the pre-rock classic pop grace of ""How?"" an intricate guitar-and-marimba workout ""The Midnight Bell,"" or the album-closing stunner, ""You, the Queen,"" a jazzy love song full of longing, regret, and hope.

Formed by vocalist Cedric Bixler and guitarist Omar Rodriguez after the split of their former band--Texan hardcore legends At the Drive-In, who splintered acrimoniously in 2001--the Volta are an unashamedly progressive outfit, dealing in grandiose arrangements that come on like Led Zeppelin fired through Saturn's rings.You can still hear many of ATDI's hallmarks inside the spasmodic dynamics of ""Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt"" and ""Eriatarka""--it's just now they're immeasurably more complex, governed by time signatures responsible only to some alien logic, and cast out on ever more remote waves of mind-bending conceptual fantasy.Bixler's serrated howl has mellowed somewhat, veering here from tender croon to shrill falsetto. And interestingly, Flea guests here, although you wouldn't know it: his brooding basslines bear nothing of the slap-happy funk he displays in the Red Hot Chilli Peppers. But ironically, the most startling contribution comes from the band's late sound manipulator Jeremy Ward, who passed away after a heroin overdose on the eve of this album's release. His dubby ambient fills unfurl in the valleys between each jagged instrumental peak, lending a truly otherworldly feel to proceedings.

Emotional Technology&#x92;s centerpiece and soul come in the form of ""Dark Heart Dawning"" and ""The Great Escape,"" two of his more abstract pieces. The former quivers with a droning, Radioheadish sense of adventure (with instrumental backing provided by Guns N&#x92; Roses&#x92; rhythm section) slowly yielding to an unexpected gospel coda. The latter goes almost gothic with layers of cello (provided by Fortus) cushioning a reverberating piano line and Caroline Lavelle&#x92;s lush vocal. Ninety seconds in, the song takes a left-hand turn into uptempo territory with sparkling computerized embellishment. Lest the proceedings get too arcane, BT returns to earth with the playful ""Paris,"" which features a raspier, untethered vocal. Actually, it&#x92;s the singing on Emotional Technology that lingers longest. BT lets loose on several tracks, gleefully strutting his stuff as a frontman singing with hard rock abandon on ""Circles."" Despite the Stones jones, BT doesn&#x92;t exile his classical breeding, which is too embedded to be completely buried beneath his rawk inklings. At seventy-eight minutes, Emotional Technology gets a bit long in the tooth, but you get the feeling that the myriad streams of sound -- high and low, organic and digital -- that pass between (and through) his ears, have finally nestled together in a grandiose manner he envisioned.Andrew Dansby--From URB Magazine",Nettwerk

Firstly, this double CD has no cohesive link, other than the fact that it sounds like a pair of solo albums stitched together to demo exactly how Andre&#x92;s yin works to augment Big Boi&#x92;s yang. Andre 3000&#x92;sLove Belowdisc rates as the more eclectic of the two, given that he&#x92;s turned in his emcee credentials to become a full-on funk-soul-jazz vocalist who mostly sings about items of love (""Happy Valentine's Day""), carnal lust (""Spread""), and female adoration (""Prototype""). Minus the big band schmaltz of ""Love Hater"" and cheesy cover jobs (""My Favorite Things""), Andre&#x92;s disc is sick (meaning great). As is to be expected, the Big Boi disc is less arty, more gangsta and worldly, and features the less-progressive guest raps of ATL crunk purveyorsLil&#x92; Jon and The Eastside Boyz(""Last Call"") andJay-Zwho rhymes the hook on ""Flip Flop Rock"". Unlike Big Boi, Andre keeps his collabos to a minimum, once crooning alongsideNorah Joneson the cool yet sappy ""Take Off Your Cool"", and once withKelis. Boi fulfills his Dungeon Family duty with flying colors by flipping some dirty southern up-tempo raps over electro beats on ""GhettoMusick"". By the timeCee-Losermonizes on ""Reset"",SpeakerboxxandLove Belowrate mostly as majestic and inspiring, with the remaining 23 per cent being just plain incredible--Dalton Higgins",

Other familiar material includes a close, if foreshortened, copy ofAl Green&#x92;s version of ""How Do You Mend a Broken Heart,"" and the standard ""For All We Know,"" so memorably sung byBillie HolidayonLady in Satin. A fair bit of time is spent making sure we know that despite his success, Ruben hasn&#x92;t changed. Indeed, he comes off as modest and charming; as for electrifying, he&#x92;s less so. As a CD that could&#x92;ve easily pandered much more to the whims of casual TV viewers, though,Soulfulis a perfectly acceptable debut.--Rickey Wright",

But the melancholy earnestness and mood of contemporary dislocation and romantic ambivalence that infusedHow Was Tomorrowhave weathered the shift to more aggressive instrumentation on laments like ""Shadow of Doubt,"" ""Dealing with the Distance,"" and ""Tillsonburg."" A few of the new songs, like ""Sweet"" and the grimly sensual ""Give Me Your Hips,"" offer fleeting respite from the pervasive gloom and uncertainty.

But the parallels are undeniable. Even though this is formerly his singer-songwriter project, much of his main band's emo-pop enthusiasm spills over into the upbeat arrangements and bright melodies. The feeling of Americana that comes across onWorse for the Wear, Pryor's third album under the New Amsterdams name, is not like that of, say,Ryan Adams, despite the rapsy voice, twilight glow of the creaky Rhodes organ, and the confessional-style songwriting. This is simply stripped-down pop with a twang, marking both a curious departure from the usualGram Parsonspalette and the potential birth of new genre, with standout songs like ""The Spoils of the Spoiled"" and ""Hanging on for Hope"" acting as signifiers along the way.

Incubus are probably on firmer ground with ""Made for TV Movie"" (like ""Megalomaniac"" it's an anti-War-on-Terror diatribe) and musically they're to be applauded for sidestepping the prescripted expectations of the metal genre they've been saddled with. Ultimately, however, one's enjoyment of this record swings on whether one considers Brandon Boyd's societal musings to be deeply venerable discourse or just soppy waffle.--Kevin Maidment",

Mobb Deep became known coast to coast for their hellishly lyrical depiction of New York street life in the Queens projects, & a production style of haunting melodies & hard-hitting beats. At the end of a decade, Mobb Deep debuted at #3 on the Billboard album chart & made a rapid rise to platinum, exemplifying exactly how far the duo had come without compromising their harsh approach.

These platters follow their self-titled effort, The Rowans (1975), denoting the first time all three had recorded together. As a trio, their strengths range from superlative songwriters to equally endowed vocalists and instrumentalists. This is especially true of Peter Rowan's mandolin and acoustic guitar mastery, which would become part of the combo's trademark sound. Their shot of reggae on ""Love Is"" works well within the context of standard fare such as ""Tired Hands,"" ""Mongolian Swamp/Kings Men,"" and the extended eight-plus minute Spanish love ballad ""Joaquin Murrieta,"" the latter being one of Peter's finest contributions to the album. ""If I Only Could"" became their sole charting side and offers easygoing and countrified rock that matched their West Coast contemporaries America and Crosby, Stills & Nash. Contrasting this relatively solid long-player was Jubilation (1977), dismissing their inherent eclecticism for a more appealing middle-of-the-road and pop-friendly vibe that ultimately yielded an uneven affair. The results vacillate from the tepid ""Best of Friends"" and the hopelessly dated ""New Horizons"" to a few hidden nuggets such as Peter's ""Don't Say Goodbye"" -- featuring jazz legend Stephane Grappelli (violin) -- and Chris and Peter's achingly beautiful ""Love's Secret Sighs."" Although neither sold particularly well initially, they are harbingers of later collaborations such as the brilliant Americana collection Tree on a Hill (1994), which would be billed as Peter Rowan & the Rowan Brothers. ~ Lindsay Planer, Rovi",

On the whole,Finally Wokensounds like someone finally told Beth Orton to cheer up, and at its best the album finds Jem reveling in all the studio tricks available to her. The opener, ""They,"" loops a nonsensical children's chorus to create a mood of Danny Elfmanesque creepiness, while ""Come On Closer"" and ""24"" manage to use crunching electric guitars and strings while avoiding any comparison to Evanescence. The title track combines a loping beat with a jazzy vocal delivery that's reminiscent of Portishead, and ""Save Me"" is a better-than-average R&amp;B track that's sure to be covered for years to come. Unfortunately, too much of the album's latter half sinks into a slow-paced Didoesque electronic slurry, though Jem's to be applauded for at least trying to liven things up with the cod-reggae of ""Wish I.""--Robert Burrow",ATO

London-based DJ Sam Zaman (aka State of Bengal) encouraged Paban Das Baul, who is accustomed to interpreting 500-year-old texts, to write his own lyrics for the first time and the singer sounds organic and relaxed amid Zaman's sitar-and-bass-heavy, snare-driven chillout milleu. But this is not so extreme a cultural conundrum as it may at first appear. Paban has long since learned to read and now lives in Paris, where he enjoys making art.

There are a few less, er, diplomatic tracks that might not win over new fans who don't share their interest in radical activist dogma; on the other hand, a track like ""Hell Yeah (Pimp the System)""--with its get-money-quick schemes (performing stick-ups or skimming cash from the register at work) and a remix featuringJay-Z--might expand the audience.

So whenEminemkick starts D12's sophomore effort by spewing vulgar rhymes to the tune of the adolescent ""Name Game"" on ""Git Up,"" it's not entirely unexpected. But can D12 ever be considered anything other than an Eminem science project gone awry? ""My Band,"" a pure novelty track (and this album's ""Purple Pills""), addresses this question. Rather than lament the fact that nobody cares about the rest of the Em's crew, group members Proof, Kuniva, Swift, and Bizarre celebrate their obscurity while Shady himself croons a painfully catchy off-kilter hook. In fact, most of the crew's punch lines and hooks tend to be overshadowed by Him. Plus, Eminem produces a sizable chunk of the tracks, which is not necessarily a good thing considering his rhyme skills trump his beat-making skills considerably. With the exception of Mr. Proof's banging production on ""Good Die Young"" and Bizarre's creepy shock rap come-ons on ""U R the One,"" D12's world sounds too much like an Eminem side project. Beat contributions byKanye West(title cut) andDr. Dre(""American Psycho 2"") bolster the overall product, but not to the level of an Eminem solo album.--Dalton Higgins",MUSIC

The result sounds livelier thandagger, putting Sasha's superb instinct for dance flow to work. Still, despite the presence ofFelix Da Housecat's ""Watching Cars Go By"" stomper, it's a very even record; themes patiently recede and resurface from the bubbly bottom of the mix.

""Everybody's talking how I can't be your love,"" she pouts in a melodically engineered stutter on opener ""Be Be Your Love,"" one of several tracks pairing her with a piano that seems to take the brunt of the punishment for her wrecked relationships. The rest of the disc unravels with similar heat: When she growls in her full-time rasp that ""(You've) worn me down/like a road/I did everything you told"" on the very infectious indie-rock leaning ""Worn Me Down,"" you believe her. But the less stormy numbers work as well, with ""1963"" coming off as flower-power pop grounded by a voice that knows better and ""I Want You"" wending its way through a fat, heartsick wallow to emerge someplace burnt in honesty. A late minute-long instrumental feels more tasteful than pretentious, adding to a monster of a debut already fueling hopes that happenstance--the term, not the album--will play a miniscule part in Yamagata's eventual output. --Tammy La Gorce",

""Dreams,"" for example, uses a sample ofCaptain Sensible's 1982 hit ""Happy Talk"" to hilarious effect. Sober reflection remains part of the Rascal worldview too, as on ""Imagine,"" a truly fragile wisp of synth and strings reminiscent ofAphex Twin's ambient moments.

Junior Jack's album debutTrust Itis more a collection of good dance records than the fluffy mess of electronic music that often results from the pressure to show a supposedly more creative side.Ignoring the contrived intro and skits, if you like the big funky house of ""Thrill Me"" or ""E Samba,"" the majority of this album will delight. Tunes like ""Da Hype"" and ""Stupid Disco"" are proper upfront anthems and the progressive ""Do It"" is like a rougher, funkier version ofThomas Bangalter's ""Scratch."" On occasion the jazz and Latin vibes are used a little too much, as with the meandering house that is ""Alone""; it's not a bad track but it sounds a little dated compared to the rest of the album. The same applies to ""Hola,"" which cynically sounds like it was made especially for an Ibizan terrace. A potential radio crossover hit is the summer-friendly ""Luv 2 U,"" which mixes the serotonin-soaked disco ofRoger Sanchezwith aMarlena Shawvocal sample.Trust Itis a good album of funky house with most tracks sounding good in a club but as a DJ wouldn't play all 14 songs back to back, it's unlikely that many listeners will either. --David Trueman",

Driver's voice is a wistful and stylish hybrid of a rather morose and breathyKathleen Edwardsand a more austereSheryl Crow, raiding her own rather colorful autobiography for material, giving fans a chance to pick apart her rather melancholy lyrics to decipher which one of her famous beaus--like Matt Damon, Harrison Ford, Josh Brolin, or John Cusack--inspired them.

Legend first made his name on Philly's incense-clouded, '70s-obsessed neo-soul scene, then found his way to New York and became West's right-hand man in the studio. His patron's pop smarts serve Legend well--while many contemporary R&B; records rely too heavily on a singer's cadence and skill to carry underdeveloped tunes, Legend and West have composed genuine songs like the perky ""Number One,"" which has a lovestruck West jabbering that he no longer believes that ""my heart don't got nothing to do with my penis."" (It's way more convincing thanSnoop Dogg's pledge of love on the next track, ""I Can Change."") And even when the melodies are slight, West slides some nasty bass lines underneath, hinting at just enough of a hip-hop sensibility to keep the album from drifting into retro nostalgia. Yet Legend is no mere producer's plaything. His voice isn't immediately distinctive; he's neither as careworn as Anthony Hamilton nor as creamy asD'Angelo. But his gift for restraint sets him apart: the sex-as-drug metaphor of the title track is hardly fresh, but Legend delivers it smoothly enough to make it work, without pressing the issue. All bedroom come-ons have been used before. This late in the game, it's a matter of how well you use 'em. --Keith Harris",

First among equals is exhilaration: Few can sit through pop this inventive--titillating, even, on the thumping disco dazzler ""Bedroom Toys,"" which featuresChic's Nile Rodgers--without owning up to a genuine thrill. And though the original fab five, as they're being heralded on this first disc in more than 20 years, leans a little heavier on Andy Taylor's guitar work than in the past, the band stays loyal to its original electropop sound, skillfully shuttling the faithful back in time but kicking in enough keyboard wizardry to avoid leaving them feeling old. Once the inevitable buzz dissipates (give it a while--the sunniness of opening anthem and first single ""(Reach Up for) The Sunrise"" sticks around, as does the moodiness of ""Still Breathing""), puzzlement takes its place. Simon Le Bon sounds not a day older than when he recorded ""Girls on Film,"" something for which he owes fellow 80s-band singers who flopped on the comeback trail an explanation. More puzzling still, though, is why Duran Duran waited so long to return: Had they reunited sooner, legions of dedicated, sophisticated popsters might have been spared the indignity that was the boy-band craze. --Tammy La GorceTalking with Duran DuranAmazon.com contributor Beth Massa spoke with lead singer Simon LeBon and keyboardist Nick Rhodes separately to discuss the band's original line-up reunion, the passion they felt recordingAstronaut, and their appreciation for their female fan base.Listen to the interview with Simon LeBonListen to the interview with Nick Rhodes",Sony

An onslaught of substance is more what it feels like, actually, and it grabs hold early. Though each of these songs is distinctive enough to avoid congealing with the others into a gorgeous glop of introspection, heavy sighs, and reflection, leadoff track and first single ""Breathe (2 A.M.)"" works small wonders as a flagship song. Its simple, lonely piano swirls into guitars that stop just short of rocking, allowing plenty of room for Nalick's unaffected voice to spill in.

He innovated salsa music with his two-trombone La Perfecta groups, and his propulsive piano style combines McCoy Tyner&#x92;s power and Thelonious Monk&#x92;s dark, chordal shadings. On this CD, Palmieri is backed by his long-time combo, augmented by special guest stars. Six of the ten tracks were written by the maestro, including the evocative trio track, ""La Gitana"" with guitaristJohn Scofield. But the highlights of this date are Palmieri&#x92;s sizzling takes on four jazz classics.  The Dizzy Gillespie hit ""Tin Tin Deo"" is signatured byDavid Sanchez'sLatin-tempoed tenor. Monk&#x92;s ""In Walked Bud,"" dances with a Palladium-era pulse.

The opening ""When in Rome"" perfectly encapsulates the aggressive approach the band favors, and features poetic lyrics far more obtuse than those of most groups with similar roots. The disc's first half stays rooted in a fairly conventional folk mode, with a lovely cover of Bob Dylan's ""Tomorrow Is a Long Time"" (one of the few solo vocal turns from fiddler Sara Watkins) and ""Jealous of the Moon"" (cowritten with the Jayhawks' Gary Louris) obvious highlights.But the album gradually grows darker. The songs take unexpected twists that are challenging and unconventional, while still emphasizing those angelic vocal harmonies that float and sting. Chris Thile's peppy instrumental ""Stumptown"" leads into the menacing ""Best of Luck,"" with its edgy minor-key chorus echoed by Watkins's deceptively sweet voice spitting out lyrics of an obsessive high-school love affair gone wrong. And the drums of ""Helena,"" one of the group's most radical compositions, bring out Nickel Creek's inner Coldplay. Not a complete break with their bluegrass beginnings,Why Should the Fire Die?is certainly the trio's boldest and most creative album, albeit one that might not appeal to their earliest fans.--Hal Horowitz",

A little more sung than screamed,Jagged Little Pill Acousticis certainly less edgy than the original, but then again, so is Alanis herself. Now a 30-something Grammy-winner, she has far less to be angst-y about. The disc opens with one of its highlights, a slightly East Indian-tinged ""All I Really Want"" which includes a more controlled vocal than the original, backed by Arabic-influenced instrumentation. The new take is most charming, as is ""Right Through You"" which proves to be another case of improving on the original. Morissette's vocals soar through the chorus, now swooping over a host of (once again) Eastern-influenced strings. The vitriolic ""You Oughtta Know""--perhaps the most rockin' track on the original CD--is now more contemplative in it's pace and sensibility, as is ""You Learn""'s new mellower melody.So there are moments of beauty, but also some of the same old, same old.  Why, then, does one need this disc? For die-hard fans, the curio factor is reason enough. Marginal Alanis fans, those who found the original too screechy, will get the chance to hear the songs toned-down.

This resulted in two artistic triumphs but no hits. That didn't deter Nelson and Jennings from hiring Was to produce their album with Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson as the Highwaymen.The Road Goes on Foreveris easily the best of the three Highwaymen albums, even if changing radio tastes will probably doom it to the poorest sales of the three. The two earlier releases, 1985'sHighwaymenand 1990'sHighwaymen 2, were thrown together as if the sheer star power of the four singers could carry the project. Both albums had their exciting moments when everything clicked but both also had a lot of filler. By contrast, Was approached the new recording as if every song and every arrangement had to be good enough to be a single. He picked one obscure but terrific composition from each of the four singers and supplemented them with equally strong material from four of Texas's best songwriters--Steve Earle, Billy Joe Shaver, Robert Earl Keen Jr., and Stephen Bruton. Nelson's harmonica ace Mickey Raphael and Kristofferson's singing buddy Billy Swan are joined by top L.A. session pros like keyboardist Benmont Tench and drummer Kenny Aronoff to create a sound that has the twangy picking of old-fashioned country and the fat bottom of modern pop. The result is an album with everything: first-rate material, grade-A playing, and inimitable singing. The thread that ties Nelson, Jennings, Cash, and Kristofferson together is the crustiness of their voices (a honey-voiced singer like George Jones or Don Gibson would seem out of place in this crowd); when they sing Shaver's ""(I'm Going To) Live Forever,"" they sound as if they're more than halfway there. The Highwaymen are so naturally hard-bitten and world-weary that they can slip a little sentiment into a song without spoiling it. They use this to great advantage on the album's two great outlaw songs, Earle's ""The Devil's Right Hand"" and Keen's title tune; the gruff tales of violence lead up to a sobering admission of the price paid for such a life. That same gruffness allows the Highwaymen to sing two religious meditations, Jennings's ""I Do Believe"" and Cash's ""Death and Hell,"" without once sounding sanctimonious.--Geoffrey HimesThis 10th anniversary limited edition includes a DVD containing the music video for ""It Is What It Is"" and a documentary,Live Forever: In the Studio with the Highwaymen.",

Probably. The big-voiced Oklahoman has the pipes, the look, the pedigree, and, most important, the emotional resonance to sustain a professional career. As an investment in her future, her label eschewed the easy path in putting out an album to take advantage of her publicity, going for a name producer, Dann Huff (Keith Urban, Faith Hill, Lonestar), to handle half the tracks. It also solicited material from the same top songwriters (Diane Warren, Brett James, Troy Verges, Rivers Rutherford) who stock albums by Hill, Martina McBride, Trisha Yearwood, and Wynonna. ""Jesus, Take the Wheel,"" the hit first single, shows off the best of Underwood's power vocals, while the sexy rocker ""We're Young and Beautiful"" pulls her out of her ballad-heavy comfort zone, and her autobiographical ""I Ain't in Checotah Anymore"" bolsters her authenticity. If the young performer oversings on occasion (the overwrought bonus track, ""Inside Your Heaven""), and settles for too many generic themes, she still surprises in her ability to go head-to-head with country&#x92;s reigning females.

But his mainstream success may belie the depth of his work; he has scored for film and the stage, produced ambitious records for other artists, and captured audiences around the world with his remarkable voice and songcraft. 'White Limousine' is Sheik's most realized work yet - a set of catchy, thoughtful compositions that are pro-love and anti-war, both perfectly simple and breathtakingly vast. Included in the 'White Limousine' package are two discs, labeled MINE and YOURS. MINE is Duncan's version of these songs; YOURS is a DVD-ROM enabling listeners to create their own versions. Using the software provided, the listener can isolate and remix 'White Limousine''s many sonic layers.

Recorded sporadically over a two-year period between tours,Blinders On, perhaps not surprisingly, reflects a wildly diverse, even schizophrenic quality. The songs veer from lovely, acoustic ballads such as ""Run Away Girl"" and ""I'm Sorry"" to skewed, near-experimental yet melodic pieces. ""Happy New Year"" shifts from Brian Wilson-styled chamber pop to tape-looped drums, all within four minutes. Like Wilson, Watkins uses the studio as an instrument, overdubbing himself on guitar, bass, and keyboards and stitching the track together with remarkably cohesive results. His sweet, boyish voice, sometimes reminiscent of a young Jackson Browne or Ben Folds, brings an intriguing innocence to these complex tracks, many of which don't follow traditional song structure. It's not an easy listen, but multiple spins, especially with headphones, helps one to appreciate the sheer craft and talent on this set. Sister and fellow Nickel Creek member Sara Watkins and Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers keyboardist Benmont Tench add their talents when needed, butBlinders Onis a predominantly solo undertaking.

Each one is epic (and not in the bad Creed ""arms-spread-on-the-mountaintop"" way): packing in more drama, billowing guitar solos and stealth pop hooks than the Strokes' entire back catalog.

The restless, trouble-plagued outfit that helped break alternative rock into the mainstream with a potent fusion of  punk 'n' funk in the '80s finds itself two decades on almost completely devoid of the former's energetic abandon, while the latter's effusive rhythms are considerably subdued over the course of this two-hour, 28-track collection. It's not so much that the Peppers have lost their muscular, often uber-macho edge as they have willfully tamed it in service of mature reinvention here. The mellower, often introspective, if no less potent pop ethos that characterized the crossover hit ""Under the Bridge"" blossoms fully here on tracks like disc one's ""Snow,"" ""Wet Sand,"" and the jazz-cool of ""Hey.""The title track, ""Desecration Smile,"" and ""She Looks To Me"" finds them venturing further into laid back pop ballad territory, while the tricky rhythms of ""Dani California,"" ""Charlie,"" and ""So Much I"" eventually kick into familiar top gear on the pop-savvy ""Tell Me Baby"" and hip-hop seasoned ""Storm in a Teacup."" It's not that there's a paucity of musical adventure here (""If"" and ""Animal Bar"" finds them wafting into Floydish neo-psychedelia while ""Make You Feel Better"" seems to channel no less than Joe Jackson) but that it's delivered with a subtlety--and dare we say it?--tasteful musical restraint that's a stark contrast to the band's early, overly overt nature. There's perhaps too much mid-tempo simmering and reflection going on; like most double-albums it could be focused into a much more compelling single disc. But that seems largely beside the Peppers' hooks-over-histrionics point here: an unlikely record to kick back to, and one that both challenges assumptions and eases the band into middle age with an oft languorous, if undeniably savory groove.--Jerry McCulley",RED HOT CHILI PEPPER

This disc is very different from Furtado's previous CDs, a fact immediately evident from track one, the new wave-affected ""Afraid."" A strong opener, the song is the beginning of a 1-2-3 punch of uptempo, infectious dance floor beats. The second cut, ""Maneater,"" also proves to be incredibly catchy, but the verses and keyboard sound too much like they were plucked from electroclash artist Peaches' tree, and originality is lost. The perfect summer pop song follows, the massive hit ""Promiscuous,"" which features clever interplay between Furtado and Timbaland on their sassy duet.

Slicing the set up between traditional R&B; and hip-hop-lite, the once stuck-in-the-shadows belle of Houston trades on her silky vocals and a knack for musical playfulness; hear it not only on ""Torn,"" the radio hit that propelled this project, but also on the tracks you'd expect least. ""Hey Fella,"" with fellow Houstonian Slim Thugg, is a dirty-flirty come on that'll nudge listeners into winking at strangers, and ""Tear Da Club Up"" and ""Gangsta Grillz"" rip into the atmosphere, determined to get Texas booties--booties from anywhere at all, really--shaking. On those two tracks and elsewhere, Le Toya enlists her street smart homeboys--Bun B, Jazze Pha, and Mike Jones--to set the appropriate vibe. But overall, this disc feels like a free-spirited invitation to check out her many musical layers. Detractors may fault Le Toya for latching on to better-known bangers and satisfaction-guaranteed production (hello, Jermaine Dupri!), but a close listen and a look at the credits crushes doubts about her credibility. Destiny may have left Le Toya behind, but the fellas from back home scooped her up; her voice and their presence will vault her to the top.--Tammy La Gorce",

It also speaks to those facing insurmountable odds and needing answers after falling in harms way. It&#x92;s an album that exposes pride, gossip, guilt, and shame and then reciprocates by answering it with humility, love, forgiveness and hope. Birthed from the small music-starved town of Eustis, Florida, just outside Orlando, this debut record is the culmination of five years playing shows and waiting patiently for the right opportunity. But this project would not have been possible without the EP they released two years prior appropriately titled On The Subject of Moving Forward. That project is what led them to sign with Flicker Records (Pillar, Kids in the Way), who will release the band&#x92;s first national album. A mutual love for bands like The Juliana Theory, Zao, Def Leppard, and Skid Row was their initial point of connection musically, but the band&#x92;s members soon found that their similarities ended there. They each had a different idea about how the music should take shape. While most bands find musical compromise difficult, Firefight&#x92;s sound, as well as its resiliency, was established in democracy. The band has found that sharing ideas and control is its success secret. Lead vocalist Dawn Richardson explains, ""It works best when you put the group goal above the individual. You can hear it in our music. We don&#x92;t sound like much else out there right now because we all come from different places, and our sound meets somewhere in the middle."" The remainder of the band agrees, comprising Wendy Drennen (bass), Glenn Drennen (guitar), Justin Cox (guitar, background vocals) and Phee Shorb (drums). Hints of emo-core, modern rock, and progressive metal permeate the record and its style as defined by Fireflight. This is all wrapped in a package tied together with soaring vocals and memorable melodies.  However, Fireflight wants its music and vision to be emphasized beyond themselves, doing so mainly through lyrics. Richardson&#x92;s lyrics are selfless and direct, a reflection of the band&#x92;s mission as a whole.  On ""Myself,"" she vocalizes the need for an individual to deny their own will, ""You woke me up and made me learn to love more than myself / You took my hand before I knew there was more than myself."" On ""You Decide"" she emphasizes that faith is not based on a relationship with others but with God; ""Fiction and reality collide / Faceless and so busted up inside / You&#x92;ve been searching / You&#x92;ve been crying out / Will you be destroyed by all your doubt?""   Having waited patiently since 1999, the band is now preparing to make a run at national recognition and a larger platform to share its message. Fireflight has already shared the stage with Skillet, Kutless, Emery, Anberlin, and Disciple to name a few. It recently wrapped a national tour with labelmate Kids in the Way and will make appearances at 12 major Christian music festivals this summer. And though its goals are large, the band is committed to remaining unified no matter what. The obstacles and many years invested have prepared Fireflight to keep its head grounded and to continue to make music that inspires, mends, and revitalizes. ""Finally, the doors are opening,"" says Richardson. ""It really feels like God has given us these opportunities so that we can help reach those who are wounded, those who need this music. Fireflight wants to write music that people can feel, make records that are universal enough to stand the test of time, and stay genuine and honest&#x97;or die trying.""",

Chambers can still churn out catchy melodies, which she does at every turn (the chorus to ""Sign on the Door"" is unstoppable), though she keeps them from ever becoming cloying.

That's not to suggest he's turned overly introspective--check the Jimi Hendrix cover ""Bold As Love,"" where he hits one home for guitarists who've been living in the shadow of legend everywhere, and the hard-charging ""Belief,"" which benefits from a mesmerizing, liquid groove.Continuummay be the third in a series, but a creative cop-out this is not; Mayer is his generation's musical superman--powerful, unassailable, and magnetic.

If you're a resolute follower who was once reduced to a quivering mass of humility by ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight"" and then revived by the blast of pop liberation that was ""Philadelphia Freedom"" (a single that later appeared on the CD version ofCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy, the album to which this disc is a sequel) you'll have enough invested to appreciate the concept. If, on the other hand, you're a late arrival to the Rocket Man's repertoire, you'll have to adjust your expectations.Kid,unlike more recent efforts, isn't aiming itself at the lite-FM listening masses. What it's asking instead is that you return yourself to your 1970s-era childhood bedroom, flop on the bed, and lock the door, or at least fasten an elastic band around your MTV-addled attention span. This is total-immersion music, and it's got 30 years worth of stories to tell.The Captain and the Kid are John and Bernie Taupin, his longtime songwriting partner. The music, a choir-enhanced swerve through genres including pop, rock, blues, folk, and country with signature piano riffs thrown in nearly everywhere, chronicles their splintery relationship. Innocence and hope (""Postcards from Richard Nixon"") give way to success and joy (""Just Like Noah's Ark""), which eventually leads to discontent (""Tinderbox"") and disaster (""And the House Fell Down""). A shot at redemption (""The Bridge"") later finds the Captain; reflection (""Old 67"") and a joyous reunion (the title track) follow.Theirs is ultimately a simple story, but John and Taupin suffuse it with hypnotic sentimentality--along with the narrative, echoes of past hits wander into several classic-sounding tracks. ""Tiny Dancer"" darts through the cracked-voice beauty of ""Blues Never Fade Away"" and ""The Bridge,"" for example, while ""Wouldn't HaveYou Any Other Way (NYC)"" works in hints at both ""Candle in the Wind"" and ""Where to Now St. Peter."" Other songs shake loose less likely influences (""I Must Have Lost it on the Wind"" sounds like something off a vintage Linda Ronstadt album), but all are compellingly steeped in context; if you don't get the late-disc reference to fine silk suits and six-inch heels, you'll wish you did.--Tammy La GorceSelected Favorites from Elton JohnTumbleweed ConnectionMadman Across the WaterGoodbye Yellow Brick RoadHonky ChateauCaptain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt CowboyGreatest Hits 1970-2002(Box Set)",Umgd/Interscope

In hindsight Soft Machine's evolution could have only taken place in the musical free thinking environment that was the music business of the late 60's / early 70's.

Sure, they're storytellers, but they're entertainers, too--just not in the Top 40 sense. Never ones to play it safe, their major label debut takes its inspiration from a Japanese folk tale.

It's no coincidence that both those songs climax with Urban's own crying guitar solos. As a player, his bold, midrange-heavy tone complements his most nuanced vocal performances. Another highlight is ""Raise the Barn,""  which Urban co-wrote and sings with Ronnie Dunn.

There's long been an organic unity to Nelson's signature sound--the way his conversational phrasing plays against the staccato runs of his gypsy guitar, with the backing of a band that's been with him so long he calls them Family. OnSongbird, Adams substitutes the more aggressively electric backing of his own band, the Cardinals, and plainly had a large say in selecting and arranging the material. Two highlights that most bear his imprint are ""Blue Hotel,"" which Adams wrote for the project and with which Nelson plainly connects, and the bluesy, ominous arrangement by Adams of the closing ""Amazing Grace,"" which sounds closer to ""House of the Rising Sun."" At the other extreme, Nelson's lumbering take on the Grateful Dead's ""Stella Blue,"" which culminates in an electric squall, sounds like the kind of music Willie would rather not listen to, let alone make. And the hard-edged riffing on ""$1000 Wedding"" practically bludgeons the Gram Parsons song to death. While the three Nelson originals (two old, one new) all work fine, the rest is hit (Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"") and miss (the title cut, by Fleetwood Mac's Christine McVie).

Her spiky collision of punk rock attitude and pop appeal is a revelation and her self-awareness is oddly shocking, but rather endearing, as the 5-foot-1 rapper asserts, ""I'm the biggest midget in the fame."" Wicked, irreverent, smart, and full of self-depreciating humor, this queen of grime rap pillages her autobiography on ""Those Were the Days,"" deconstructs nationalism on ""My England,"" raids Mother Goose on ""Public Warning,"" and then drops a gauntlet with a loud clattering sound, making listeners laugh out loud with the snotty, but laughable challenge of ""Love Me or Hate Me."" But mostly she keeps things moving, throwing off sparks and bon mots with her mad, furious, in-your-face flow, while adding a bit of glam and new wave to the electro hip-hop beats.

Among the highlights are the irresistibly cheesy ""Ballad of a Teenage Queen"" from his early Sun Records days, the socially conscious ""Ballad of Ira Hayes"" (the Marine whose story is told so movingly inFlags of Our Fathers), and a live, fully orchestrated rendition of Leonard Cohen's ""Bird on a Wire.""

Nas practically came into the game looking backwards (see ""Memory Lane"" offIllmatic) but he seems more nostalgic than ever with tracks like ""Where Are They Now?,"" ""Carry on Tradition,"" ""Can't Forget About You,"" and the title song which all focus on rap's past. This reminiscing can only fan the dim candle fans keep lit for Nas, hopeful that he'll make a full return to his former glory. But, once again, the rapper teases and falls short. As has become habit, Nas does manage to knock out a handful of excellent songs (""Can't Forget"" and ""Play on Playa"" for example), along with a handful of awful fare (none worse than ""Who Killed It,"" Nas's disastrous attempt to channel the spirit of '30s gangster actor Edward G. Robinson), and a few forgettable filler songs. The production is similarly uneven though Kanye West's and Will.I.Am's contributions are reliably listenable. The biggest shortcoming is that given it's titleHip Hop Is Deadaspires to be an event album but it never delivers on that promise despite the heady symbolism of former rival Jay-Z joining him on ""Black Republicans.""

Jason Quever's the brainchild, voice, and songwriter for the 10 tracks here, sporting a lo-fi yearn and a fascination for the pivot points where post-innocence folk mutates with indie rock. The audio mix is key: acoustic guitars, bass, organ, and drums become a hazy shimmer, so closely entwined that they almost become a single sound as Quever sings in a reverb-soaked, softly high pitch. Quever goes into an indecipherable warble at points on ""Found Bird,"" amid whistles and martial snare-drum accompaniment, but for the most part he's poised frontally with a touch of confessionalism and more than a strong dash of simple, folkie naivet&#xE9;, right where it crosses paths with lovelorn psychedelia. --Andrew Bartlett",

It sounds like nothing Jones has previously released, or anything characterizable as contemporary Christian. Instead, her voice soars and wobbles through repetitive, stream-of-consciousness incantations over rhythmic throbs and pulses. On ""Where I Like It Best,"" Jones testifies to the power of private prayer (while seeming to cast churchgoers as hypocrites). The feral distortions of ""Tried to Be a Man"" recall some of the textures (if not the themes) of her former boyfriend Tom Waits, while the acoustic setting of ""Donkey Ride"" features guitar tunings that might make Sonic Youth wince and ""Elvis Cadillac"" conjures a singular vision of heaven. At close to eight and a half minutes, the closing ""I Was There"" seems to follow Van Morrison into the mystic. Some of this music is oddly affecting; much of it is merely odd.--Don McLeese",New West

The Scottish quartet's a scrappy and needly bunch, opening their debut with ""Comin Down,"" an angular, barking tune that gets its power dually from Kyle Falconer's short, sharp wail and a piercing twin-guitar slash. Those same guitars dish out sweet strumming for ""Same Jeans,"" a danceably jumping paean to night-clubbing, sidewalk musicians, and ""dressing down."" The View like their guitars transluscent and sunny, as on ""The Don,"" where they go all call-and-response, making a fast-shuffling vibe that brings Falconer from sweet-voiced narration to a scouring shout, as his mates harmonize, increasing the sunniness. Like their countrymen in the Fratellis, the View ought to find that bigger stage to stumble toward.--Andrew Bartlett",

They're a perfect example of a modern ""cult"" band; they have a large following and make most of their money touring, existing largely outside the weblog-and-myspace-driven word of mouth which propels most indie-label, rock-based music these days. The group consciously limited their sound this time around, after taking a two year hiatus.Changewas recorded in Auckland, New Zealand at a recording school with equipment on loan by the brilliant Chris Knox, then later in Brooklyn at Oneida's headquarters without their usual array of vocoders or any of their regular gear. Easily their best album since 2000'sRed Line,Sex Changeis typically eclectic but pushes their sound further towards '70s stadium prog, keyboard-driven Krautrock, shredding '80s rock, John Carpenter soundtracks from the late 1970s, super clean and mellow funk-rock, and whatever you call the kind of music they play behind sports play-by-plays.--Mike McGonigal",
