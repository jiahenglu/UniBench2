Great for parties, family get-togethers, and warm summer days, the large 6-quart hand-cranked ice cream maker is the life of any party.At a GlanceNew England white pine bucketCorrosion-resistant, cast-iron, triple-action dasherThree-gear drive hand-cranked systemSteel inner bucketMakes 6 quarts of ice cream in 30 to 45 minutes5-year limited warrantyRecipes included&nbsp;FeaturesBucket:The wood bucket is crafted of select pine from New England and bound with strong galvanized hoops and electroplated fittings to ensure lasting stability.Canister:The tall canister design allows the ice cream to come in close contact with the ice and rock salt making it freeze faster. Our canister is manufactured of heavy-duty stainless steel that will provide years of ice cream making service.Dasher:The patented dasher system is constructed of heavy-duty cast iron and is electroplated for lasting durability. It will never warp out of shape like plastic dashers are prone to do. And the beech wood blades are self-adjusting to ensure uniform scraping of the ice cream mixture on the canisters interior sidewall.BucketCanisterDasherThe White Mountain Experience&nbsp;The White Mountain Experience started in the 1850s.Founded in 1853, we&rsquo;ve always been about making good times happen right at home with ice cream you make yourself. The experience starts with the discussion--often the kids get their pick--of what flavor ice cream your family wants to make. Vanilla with bittersweet chocolate chips or maybe peach made with orchard fresh peaches. Every delicious choice is limited only by your imagination. Just set up your White Mountain ice cream maker with ice and rock salt, and let the fun begin. Whether you&rsquo;re cooling off a hot summer picnic or warming up a homebound winter weekend, the experience is one you can&rsquo;t put a price on.Our secret is the triple-motion dasher.At the heart of the White Mountain ice cream maker is a uniquely designed, twin-blade ""dasher."" The outer canister turns clockwise and the blades turn both clockwise and counter clockwise. That triple-motion action continuously folds the ingredient mixture from the outer walls back onto itself creating the smoothest and creamiest down-home ice cream ever made.",White Mountain

B00004R8ZE,Kuhn Rikon Stainless-Steel Pressure Cooker,179.7,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418m71jtfpL._SY300_.jpg,{'Kitchen & Dining': 25834},"[['Home & Kitchen', 'Kitchen & Dining', 'Cookware', 'Pressure Cookers']]","Beginning in the 1930s, two successive generations of busy cooks used pressure cookers to prepare family meals. The next generation, with memories of valves dancing and hissing on stovetops, snubbed pressure cookers. Now pressure cookers have come back, those old valves replaced by modern versions that ensure safety while delivering the speed, ease, and nutritional benefits of pressure cooking. Pressure cooking also saves 70 percent of the energy normally consumed while cooking.This heavyweight, stainless-steel beauty is a fine example of contemporary engineering and style. Its mirror finish gleams, and its black handles--including a loop handle for two-handed lifting--stay cool. Pressure-cooking traps steam to heat foods at temperatures higher than boiling. An aluminum disk in the base, sandwiched by stainless steel, speeds the process even more through fast heat conductivity. It's safe on electric, gas, ceramic, and induction stovetops. Little water is required, so nutrients, flavor, and color are not boiled away. Vegetables emerge vibrantly colored from the steamer insert. Stews, soups, beans--even meat loaf, pork chops, and desserts such as bread pudding--come out tasty and nutritious. (A booklet containing dozens of recipes is included.) You can brown meats in the pot before the lid is locked on, or use the pot without the lid. The stem of the operating valve shows high and low pressure so you can adjust heat for different foods. After cooking, the pressure can be reduced slowly (just let the cooker sit for a while), normally (press the pressure indicator), or quickly (run tepid water on the lid's rim).Safety measures abound: the lid twists onto the pot; a rubber gasket ensures a tight seal. A vent releases steam if pressure builds too high, as does a valve that also locks the lid when any pressure whatsoever is inside the cooker. Cleanup is a bit involved: hand wash the pot, gasket, and lid with a mild detergent, then lightly oil the gasket. Normally the valve is self-cleaning, but if food passes through it, disassembly is required. Minor cleaning inconvenience, though, should not overshadow the major convenience of pressure cooking.--Fred Brack",Kuhn Rikon

Its 5-cup capacity handles dry ingredients for even a large, three-layer cake, and the heavy-weight stainless-steel construction and shiny, streamlined design add a modern sensibility to a traditional baking tool.With a spring-action hand trigger, this sifter can be squeezed with one hand or shaken side to side with both hands to evenly distribute ingredients through the fine mesh screens. If you're new to sifting, be sure to sift flour and ingredients before measuring to achieve the best results; sift onto waxed or parchment paper, and then measure the required amounts. The sifter is dishwasher-safe, but to make sure there's no build-up of ingredients inside the sifter, hand wash in hot soapy water and dry thoroughly. Known for manufacturing innovative tools and gadgets for home cooks, Amco scores a hit with this professional-weight, high-quality contemporary take on a classic sifter.--Emily Wolf",Amco

Mundial's steel contains diamond dust, so it's hard enough to partially sharpen blades, though it won't replace a professional sharpening job, which proceeds from coarse to ever-finer grinding at tightly controlled angles. This steel performs only the final grinding, during which an edge is polished. Thus, properly used, it can lengthen the intervals between sharpenings better than a steel without diamond dust. Since a steel should be at least as long as the knife blade being drawn across it, this steel's length is fine for most household knives, and its oval shape exposes more surface to blades.--Fred Brack",Mundial

One blade creates up to 49 3/8-inch fries with a single lever-push. The other creates up to 25 half-inch fries. You'll get those numbers, however, only if you precisely shape a large potato to fit the bed. The bed's size is the cutter's only drawback. Even if you cut a large potato to fit the head, the fry length is at most 3-1/2 inches. That length, however, is ideal for carrot, cucumber, and zucchini batons to assemble a vegetable tray around a bagna cauda, an Italian dipping sauce of olive oil, butter, garlic, and anchovies. And such batons get you halfway to a pretty dice for a vegetable soup. Hand wash.--Fred Brack",Prepworks from Progressive

Because this tool's surface contains diamond dust, it's hard enough to somewhat sharpen  a blade. While using this steel won't replace a professional sharpening job, which proceeds from coarse  grinding to ever-finer grinding at tightly controlled angles, it will lengthen intervals between sharpenings.  This steel will also perform better than a steel without diamond dust because it accomplishes the final task  of a professional sharpening, which is polishing the edge to a fine point while realigning the edge.

PFOA has been used as a catalyst in the production of PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene), the basic building block for all nonstick cookware surfaces.PFOA is a chemical that is hard to break down in the environment. It has a half life of 3.8 years, meaning that if there are 4 grams of PFOA in the body today, the body will have 2 grams in it in four years from now, 1 gram in eight years from now and so on. The human metabolism does not remove PFOA. While it is not a carcinogen or toxin and is generally assumed inert and not harmful to your health, it is environmentally unfriendly and just sticks around forever. That is why the EPA and the leading nonstick manufacturer have agreed that by 2010, the amount of PFOA used to produce PTFE compounds need to be cut by 95%, and by 2015 no PFOA could be used, at all.Towards the end of this process, PFOA is completely extracted via ionization filters. Even if any traces of PFOA were still present by the time the nonstick compound reached the cookware factory, the pan surface curing temperatures would destroy such remnants. The same is true for the old nonstick compound used for Scanpan Classic and Scanpan Professional. That's why Scanpan has always been able to present the finished product as not containing PFOA.Scanpan cookware has always been PFOA free, but the negative publicity that PFOA and, by extension, PTFE had received over the last few years, had caused Scanpan to work closely with their suppliers to find a substitute for PFOA that is biodegradable. Scanpan received patents on PFOA-free technology in 2007 and has been producing Scanpan Classic and Scanpan Professional with this new process since spring 2007.

Assemble the glass cover handle, if applicable, following the instructions on the poly bag that holds all handle parts. Tighten by hand, only, do not use tools. Make sure the small washer that goes on the underside of the glass cover is flush with the glass surface. If not, turn the washer around and re-assemble the handle.2. Heat pan to working temperature. Medium heat is typically sufficient for frying and sauteing. Since each stove top has its own settings, find the best heat setting for your stove by starting at a lower setting, then gradually increase until water splashed on the pan surface evaporates immediately with a sizzle.

Made in Denmark of pressure-cast aluminum, the heavy-gauge pan features low sides, perfect for sliding out eggs, and a ceramic-titanium nonstick finish that is safe for use with metal utensils. The high-density phenolic resin handle is securely attached without rivets to facilitate stirring and cleaning, and is guaranteed not to come loose. Should you wish to bake a German apple pancake, the fry pan is oven-safe to 500 degrees F. While dishwasher-safe, washing by hand is recommended to best preserve the nonstick finish.In response to environmental concerns regarding nonstick finishes, Scanpan in 2007 introduced its Green Tek nonstick technology. Working with its suppliers, Scanpan is the first cookware company to completely eliminate the use of the harmful chemical PFOA from the entire process used to make its nonstick compound. The new PFOA-free nonstick finish is now found on all Scanpan Classic and Professional cookware. Scanpan covers its cast-aluminum cookware with a full lifetime warranty.--Ann BieriFrom the ManufacturerAbout Green Tek Nonstick Technology:In the more recent past, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken the leading manufacturer of nonstick compounds to task over excessive emissions of PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid). PFOA has been used as a catalyst in the production of PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene), the basic building block for all nonstick cookware surfaces.PFOA is a chemical that is hard to break down in the environment. It has a half life of 3.8 years, meaning that if there are 4 grams of PFOA in the body today, the body will have 2 grams in it in four years from now, 1 gram in eight years from now and so on. The human metabolism does not remove PFOA. While it is not a carcinogen or toxin and is generally assumed inert and not harmful to your health, it is environmentally unfriendly and just sticks around forever. That is why the EPA and the leading nonstick manufacturer have agreed that by 2010, the amount of PFOA used to produce PTFE compounds need to be cut by 95%, and by 2015 no PFOA could be used, at all.Towards the end of this process, PFOA is completely extracted via ionization filters. Even if any traces of PFOA were still present by the time the nonstick compound reached the cookware factory, the pan surface curing temperatures would destroy such remnants. The same is true for the old nonstick compound used for Scanpan Classic and Scanpan Professional. That's why Scanpan has always been able to present the finished product as not containing PFOA.Scanpan cookware has always been PFOA free, but the negative publicity that PFOA and, by extension, PTFE had received over the last few years, had caused Scanpan to work closely with their suppliers to find a substitute for PFOA that is biodegradable. Scanpan received patents on PFOA-free technology in 2007 and has been producing Scanpan Classic and Scanpan Professional with this new process since spring 2007. With their new Green Tek technology, there is no PFOA used at any stage of the entire process, resulting in a ""clean and green"" nonstick PTFE compound, the production of which no longer uses chemicals that could have a negative impact on the environment.The performance of the Scanpan Green Tek surface is not different in any way from the performance of Scanpan's previous surface.

The detailed manual and video that come with this professional-style machine spare no small detail while guiding you through the espresso and cappuccino process. With proper equipment, La Pavoni argues, including very fine grounds and a state-of-the art machine, an espresso or cappuccino can be a work of art. Because cafe prices are rising and an improperly made espresso is indistinguishable from mud, it's worth investing the time and equipment required for a rich and truly satisfying espresso experience. For me, one thing that separates a barista-style cappuccino from many homemade efforts is the quality of the foam. The Europiccola produces foam with just right amount of frothiness, although the foam can also be controlled if you prefer less enthusiastic frothing. For top-quality cappuccinos, the machine should be descaled four or five times a year (descaling instructions are included). Made of gleaming chrome, this strikingly attractive machine should not be cleaned with abrasives.--Laura CuthbertEditor's note: This item may arrive with water inside from the manufacturer's pressure test.

Because cast iron is  unmatched for heat retention and distribution--no hot spots--that crust will be  crisp and uniform. The skillet is 9 inches in diameter, and each wedge is 3-1/2  inches long and 1 inch deep. The skillet weighs 5-1/2 pounds, must be seasoned  by coating with melted shortening and then baked, and needs to be coated with  oil or cooking spray after each use to prevent rust.This skillet's weight and care requirements put off some cooks, but, as has been  known since the Middle Ages, cast iron permits precise baking and flavor- retentive cooking, has a natural nonstick finish when seasoned, and lasts for  generations (thereby increasing its value). As it blackens with use, cast iron  imparts to food a mystical aura of rustic nourishment and flavor.--Fred Brack",Lodge

The grinding mechanism in Peugeot salt mills is purposefully constructed with 18/10 stainless-steel, which won't corrode from prolonged contact with the salt. The top of each mill unscrews for adding peppercorns and salt, while the round ball nut can be loosened or tightened to vary the coarseness of the grind.Paris pepper and salt mills make exceptional gifts individually or as a set. The mills come in a wide range of heights, from 4-3/4 to nearly 20 inches, and in a variety of finishes, including matte chocolate and natural wood, and a shiny blue, yellow, or red lacquer. Care for a mill is easy: clean the exterior and inner chamber with a damp cloth; never immerse in water; avoid putting salt in the pepper mill, or grinding green or pink peppercorns by themselves (mixed with black is fine); and avoid damp types of salt (usually pink or gray) in the regular salt mill. Made in France, Peugeot mills are covered by a two-year replacement policy, while the grinding mechanism is covered by a lifetime warranty.

The grinding mechanism in Peugeot salt mills is purposefully constructed with 18/10 stainless-steel, which won't corrode from prolonged contact with the salt. The top of each mill unscrews for adding peppercorns and salt, while the round ball nut can be loosened or tightened to vary the coarseness of the grind.Paris pepper and salt mills make exceptional gifts individually or as a set. The mills come in a wide range of heights, from 4-3/4 to nearly 20 inches, and in a variety of finishes, including matte chocolate and natural wood, and a shiny blue, yellow, or red lacquer. Care for a mill is easy: clean the exterior and inner chamber with a damp cloth; never immerse in water; avoid putting salt in the pepper mill, or grinding green or pink peppercorns by themselves (mixed with black is fine); and avoid damp types of salt (usually pink or gray) in the regular salt mill. Made in France, Peugeot mills are covered by a two-year replacement policy, while the grinding mechanism is covered by a lifetime warranty. Peugeot has been a leading manufacturer of pepper mills since the 1840s, and is a brand preferred by many restaurants and chefs.--Ann Bieri",Peugeot

One of the civilization's oldest spices (along with its partner salt), it graces tables all over the world. When in a country where I don't speak the language and my soup needs a little pick-me-up, I just mime grinding pepper over it, and the waiter knows what I need. This wooden pepper grinder from Peugeot comes in a classic style, reminiscent of a rook from a chess set. To fill, unscrew the knob on top, remove the upper section, and pour in the peppercorns. How tightly the knob is screwed back on determines the grind. For a little variety, try a mix of black, green, and white peppercorns. Be sure to also check out the matching salt grinder.--Dana Van Nest",Peugeot

News flash--pressure cookers have come back, those old valves replaced by modern versions that ensure safety while delivering the speed, ease, and nutritional benefits of pressure cooking.This heavyweight, stainless-steel beauty is a fine example of contemporary engineering and style. Its mirror finish gleams, and its black handles, including a loop handle for two-handed lifting, stay cool. Pressure cooking traps steam to heat foods at temperatures higher than boiling. This cooker has an aluminum disk sandwiched by stainless steel in its base to speed the process even more through fast heat conductivity. It's safe on electric, gas, ceramic, and induction stovetops. Little water is required, so nutrients, flavor, and color are not boiled away. Vegetables emerge vibrantly colored from the steamer basket insert. Stews, soups, beans--even meat loaf, pork chops, and desserts like bread pudding--come out tasty and nutritious. (Recipes included.) Meats can be browned in the pot before the lid is locked on, and the pot can be used without the lid. The operating valve offers high and low pressure settings for cooking foods at ideal speeds.Safety measures abound. The lid twists onto the pot, with a rubber gasket ensuring a tight seal. A lock secures lid to pot. A vent releases steam if pressure builds too high, as does a valve that also locks the lid when any pressure whatsoever is inside the cooker. Another device indicates pressure and gently releases steam during cooking.Cleanup is a bit complicated. Hand wash pot, gasket, and lid with a mild detergent. Lightly oil the gasket. Remove and clean the operative valve. This minor cleaning inconvenience, however, should not overshadow the major convenience of pressure cooking.--Fred BrackFrom the ManufacturerFagor is Green:Fagor's mission is to use resources efficiently to preserve the environment and save energy, developing highly efficient products that consume less and save money; contributing to a healthy planet for us and our future generations.

This 6-quart cooker helps you fix these and other delicious meals in about 70-percent less time than with other cooking methods while also using one of the healthiest cooking procedures, pressurized steam, to retain more of food&#x92;s vital nutrients, delicious taste, and natural color. Made in Spain, the Duo pressure cooker is constructed of high-quality 18/10 stainless steel with an encapsulated aluminum base for even and efficient heat distribution. All ingredients go inside the cooker at once and the lid twists and locks into place. Once you set the cooker to one of two pressure settings, it is ready to go. A sliding pressure lock on the handle ensures that the lid will not open until all the pressure is released, and, for additional safety, the Duo has two pressure release valves to prevent excessive steam build-up. The cooker has a black ergonomically designed handle, along with a helper handle, that makes it easier to lift it off the stove. The Duo comes with a stainless-steel steamer basket and trivet plus a full-color cookbook with over 50 recipes and a detailed instruction manual. It is safe to use on gas, electric, ceramic, or induction stovetops and should be hand washed with mild soap to preserve the mirror finish and the gasket.--Cristina VaamondeFrom the ManufacturerFagor is Green:Fagor's mission is to use resources efficiently to preserve the environment and save energy, developing highly efficient products that consume less and save money; contributing to a healthy planet for us and our future generations.

You can even monitor two foods (beef and lamb, for instance) simultaneously, since two stainless-steel probes are included, each 6 inches long and each connected to a 39-inch stainless-steel wire.Here's how it works: program the tool (two AA batteries included) by selecting either ""beef,"" ""veal,"" ""lamb,"" ""pork,"" ""chicken,"" or ""turkey."" Then program to rare, medium-rare, medium, or well-done. The monitor displays the proper temperature--which can be altered by pressing a button. Place the probe into, say, a turkey. Run the wire from the oven and close the door. (Door should remain closed until turkey is done so oven temperature doesn't vary.) Plug the wire into the monitor, and open the monitor's built-in stand. Set the clock to the current time. (Remember, two probes can be used simultaneously for different foods, with the monitor programmed separately for each.) The monitor constantly displays the turkey's internal temperature and elapsed cooking time. (The timer can be used independently of thermometer.) When the turkey reaches the selected temperature, an alarm sounds.Meanwhile, hook the pager (two AA batteries included) to your belt or drop it into your pocket. The pager beeps when the monitor's alarm sounds and works up to 75 feet away, liberating the cook from the kitchen. The probes can also be plugged into the pager, which displays a food's temperature on its LCD screen. So barbecuing brisket outside, roasting chicken in the oven, and keeping track of both is possible.--Fred Brack",Maverick

Fortunately, with the Riedel Vinum series Chardonnay glass, the company has put its Montrachet where its mouth is and come up with a design to please not only Chardophiles, but also fans of Chenin, Viognier, the Pinot brothers--Gris and Blanc--even noble rotters from Sauternes. A Pacific Northwest Chard tasted in both the Riedel and what was previously thought to be ""the good crystal"" revealed a balanced acidic brightness in the former and a sort of boozy flabbiness in the latter. With its medium-height bowl and tapered opening, the Vinum Chardonnay glass almost forces you to purse your lips, directing the wine to the mid-tongue's acid receptors and thereby balancing the wine's fruit and oak.--Tony Mason",Riedel

Millions of households use it to extract the full flavor of sweet corn by shredding the kernels to release their milky juices and to ""milk"" corncobs of even more juices. Because it has a cutting blade as well as little shredding knives, the corn creamer can also be used to cleanly slice whole kernels from ears of corn. Either method produces corn immeasurably tastier than the canned version.The 17-inch, stainless-steel creamer is simplicity itself. Place it over a pan and butt the long end against a wall or other backstop. Place an ear of corn in the groove and push it over the shredders six or seven times. To slice kernels off a cob, raise the cutting blade by adjusting a screw, cover the shredders with the removable guard, and push the corn over the blade once. Add any combination of milk, cream, butter, salt, and pepper (maybe a pinch of sugar or cayenne, too), and heat either creamed corn or whole kernels gently.--Fred Brack",Norpro

Use your longest serrated knife when cutting, because a knife that just barely spans the width of the slicing tray will keep slipping out of the acrylic slicing guides. The guides have no top support and tend to wobble a bit as you slice. They also have inexplicably high sides; you'd have to use triple the leavening to make bread that reaches the top of them.

For speeding up the bacon-frying process, the press can be preheated--also preheat it when you're flattening hamburgers, grilled sandwiches, or quesadillas.

The timer's red face is calibrated to indicate soft, medium, and hard--and stages in between. As the timer heats up, in precise synchronization with the eggs, its face darkens from the outer edge inward, displaying the eggs' current status on the calibrated gauge.

And it easily but sturdily converts to vertical roasting by anchoring up to four hooked pieces to the slats of the flat rack, enabling two birds to roast on this roost, cooking evenly inside and out, with no danger of capon cartwheel. Flipping the bird, so to speak, is a thing of the past--there's no need to pull the rack out of the oven halfway through cooking--and you may as well roast two while you have the heat cranked up (put one in the freezer for next week).

Let's break it down a little to make the process easier.What are the different types of space heaters?Radiant heatersemit infrared radiation that directly warms the objects in front of the heaters (rather than the surrounding air). If you only need heat by a desk or in a small section of a room, a radiant heater is quiet and will use very little power.Forced-air heatersuse a fan to blow air that has been warmed by metal or ceramic heating elements. A forced-air heater is appropriate for quickly heating up a small- to medium-sized room, but can be noisy.Convection heatersdraw cold air from the floor; the air is warmed by heating coils and emitted from the top of the heater. A convection heater is appropriate for quickly heating up a small- to medium-sized room, but also can be noisy.Radiatorswork by heating oil enclosed in a reservoir, gradually heating the surrounding air. If heating speed isn't an issue, you might want to opt for a radiator. These are extremely quiet and effective--perfect for bedrooms.Should I buy an electric or a combustion model?If you want a heater that will be available in emergencies, or that can heat areas larger than a single room, choose a ""combustion"" model--one that is powered by a gas or fuel like propane, kerosene, natural gas, or diesel. Which fuel type you choose depends largely on convenience and local availability. For example, diesel would be appropriate for a heater you take with you on long car trips.How powerful a heater do I need?Heaters are rated by BTU, which stands for British Thermal Unit (the amount of heat needed to heat one pound of water by 1 degree F). To find out how many BTU you need:Calculate the volume of the space to be heated by multiplying square footage by height.Multiply that number by 4 if your insulation is poor, 3 if it's average, or 2 if it's good.The resulting number is a ballpark figure for how many BTU you'll need.Do space heaters cost a lot to operate?As a general rule, electric space heaters are more expensive to use than combustion models. To ensure energy efficiency, a thermostat is a must-have feature for any heater. For radiant heaters, models with a 360 degree heating surface can heat larger spaces. If you need a forced-air heater, models with ceramic elements tend to be more efficient.Are space heaters a fire hazard?Space heaters are implicated in about 25,000 residential fires every year. To ensure proper safety, always follow the manufacturer's usage instructions and fill out the warranty card to receive informational updates from the manufacturer. Also, look for extra safety features such as an automatic shutoff switch that can shut down the unit if, for example, it gets upended.

After assembling the grill (which takes only a few minutes), simply plug it in and allow about 10 minutes to fully preheat the surface while you gather your steaks, kebabs, or whatever's to be grilled. The electric heat has an adjustable range from low (for keeping food warm) to high (for searing steaks). The nonstick grill surface not only means you can use a minimum of added fat, but it also makes cleanup a cinch. The surface has a subtle slope, with channels that draw accumulated fat or other liquids into a tray just below the surface. The high domed and vented lid helps create a circular flow of hot air to ensure even cooking--particularly important for a large roast or whole chicken.The grill can be placed either directly on a tabletop or atop its pedestal. On its own, the grill surface stands about 6 inches high; with the pedestal, it stands about 2-1/2 feet high, not counting the domed lid. The pedestal is plenty sturdy for cooking, but the grill still seems a bit top-heavy, so pay special attention if grilling in a high-traffic area or near kids. Because of the easy electric heat, this grill can be used outdoors or indoors--when using it indoors, though, be prepared for potential spattering, steam, or other side effects of cooking.--Cynthia Nims",George Foreman

This oil-free method is refreshing when compared to bagged corn, because you don't have to contend with grease, salt, and artificial flavoring unless you dress the corn yourself after cooking. However, take care to monitor the progress of corn during the first use. The manufacturer lists a three-to-five-minute cook time for 1/2 cup of unpopped kernels, but as microwave ovens vary, it could take considerably less time to pop. And overcooked corn burns fast using this method. Luckily, the base and lid are designed not to warp or melt, so burned kernels won't damage them.

And fizz always seems to flit away faster in big 2-liter bottles of soda--every time the cap is loosened, a bit more carbon dioxide dissipates. To solve this problem, the Jokari soda dispenser replaces the cap on any 2-liter soda bottle and provides both an airtight seal and a push button method of pouring, in an effort to keep both fizz and fluid fresh. By gently shaking the bottle (before all but the first pour), the patented design propels soda up the flexible tube, where it's ready for dispensing with a push of the thumb. It's a great theory, and in general terms it works. Unfortunately, when the button is pressed, the soda sprays out in a diverging rush, the same way light diffuses from your car's headlights. The resultant violence of the soda stream tends to cause more of the carbonation to dissipate even more rapidly; seconds later, by the time the foam subsides, what's in your glass seems considerably less bubbly than if you'd poured it yourself. Preserving the fizz is a noble goal, but a bubbleless London Buck cocktail is just pathetic.--Tony Mason",HIC Harold Import Co.

By repeatedly squeezing the baglike bellows atop the unit until the sides of the plastic bottle (it's not for use with glass bottles) don't compress, you've effectively created an airtight seal and equalized the bottle's internal pressure. The pumping action can be pretty slow going, and the wait for the bulb to reinflate between squeezes can be frustrating, though the easy-to-flip release lever means the Pump & Pour need not be removed for the life of the bottle.

The Juicy Salif was devised in the second half of the 1980s (along with the Walter Wayle II wall clock, the Hot Bertaa kettle and the large Max le Chinois colander). An excellent example of Alessis role as artistic mediator in the most turbulent areas of creative potential (the piece was his response to our precise briefing for a stainless steel tray), it remains unparalleled in its ability to generate discussions about its meaning and design, partly because of its unconventional use of what semiologists refer to as the decorative veil which, even though generally in a less overt manner, is inexorably destined to cover all objects created by man. To fully understand the true meaning of its existence, it is possibly necessary to refer to the theories of Leroy-Gourham, who considers the notion of functional approximation to be fundamental. This notion suggests that there is always a certain degree of freedom in interpreting relationships between Form and Function: it is precisely this continual play between Form and Function that leads to the decorative veil mentioned above, that Floch considers to be the manifestation of the legendary and aesthetic dimension of the object, as originally defined by Greimas. As well as being the most controversial citrus fruit squeezer of the 20th century, it has also become one of the icons of design of the 1990s, and it continues to be one of the most provocatively intelligent articles in the Alessi catalog.",Alessi

The 12-inch-square model stands 8 inches tall and holds 1.5  gallons of water (enough for 18 to 24 hours). Remove the lid to add water;  replace it and flip the switch on the 5-foot cord to start humidifying. The  unit makes a pleasant purring sound as water is spun into cool mist,  which is not as fine as that produced by models using wicks and creates some wetness on the  floor in front of the unit. The manufacturer recommends periodically  changing the filter and cleaning weekly with vinegar and bleach. It's  important to keep humidifiers clean, lest you encourage the production of  mold and end up reducing indoor air quality instead of improving it.

The electric appliance's appeal lies in its simplicity and countertop convenience--not to mention its fat-fighting ability. The double-sided grill (a 6-by-7-inch nonstick cooking surface) cooks burgers, steaks, chicken, sausage, fish, shrimp, and vegetables top and bottom in minutes. (Recipes accompany the grill.) Grill marks not only look appetizing, they contribute caramelized flavor. The bottom grill's deep grooves collect fat, and the grill is sloped so the fat runs off into a dishwasher-safe plastic tray stationed under the unit's front.The nonstick bun warmer draws heat from the grill and can be used while food is grilling or by itself. (The entire unit, grill and bun warmer, turns on by plugging in the power cord.) The warmer heats a burger's bun as well as other bread items, including English muffins, tortillas, pita bread, sliced bagels, and croissants. Because the grill is nonstick, cleanup is a snap: just a quick scrape with a plastic spatula (included) and a quick wipe with a paper towel or a sponge.--Fred Brack",George Foreman

All-Clad pans with a non-stick cooking surface are oven-safe up to 400 degrees, but should not be used under the broiler. We recommend using a low to medium temperature when cooking with All-Clad. Higher heats are not necessary and may cause discoloration (see cleaning instructions below). Other features include:Beautifully polished, magnetic stainless exterior layer.Pure aluminum core that not only covers the bottom of the pan but also extends up the sides. This allows for great heat conductivity as well as an even heat distribution so you won&#x92;t have ""hot spots"" when cooking.Stainless-steel interior layer/cooking surface.Long, polished stainless, stay-cool handles.Sturdy, non-corrosive stainless-steel rivets won't react with foods.Polished stainless-steel lids fit evenly with the pan&#x92;s edges to seal in flavor of your foods.The All-Clad Stainless collection is compatible with an induction stovetop (with the exception of a few pieces) in addition to gas and electric stovetops.The Stainless collection is dishwasher-safe, excluding pieces with a nonstick cooking surface.WarrantyFrom date of purchase, All-Clad guarantees to repair or replace any item found defective in material, construction or workmanship under normal use and following care instructions. This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal.Cleaning InstructionsFor daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend. To use the Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend to remove it.All-Clad Stainless SelectionIn recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack.

This pineapple slicer peels, cores, and slices a fresh specimen in less than 30 seconds so there is no excuse for ever buying canned pineapple again. To use this ingenious little tool, you must first cut the top off of your fresh pineapple. Next, place the slicer in the middle of the pineapple and push down while turning the handle in a clockwise motion. Pull the slicer straight out of the pineapple and--voila!--your perfect little rings come out with the tool while the rough shell stays behind. Finally, simply slide the handle off the slicer and the pineapple rings slide off with it. The pineapple shell remains intact so you can use it as a dessert bowl or as a glass for pi&#xF1;a coladas. The slicer comes with three blades to tackle pineapples of any size. This tool has garnered several prestigious design awards from all over the world, including Germany&#x92;s Award for Good Industrial Design, Holland&#x92;s ION&#x92;s Good Industrial Design award, and Japan&#x92;s MITI Award for Excellent Foreign Product.--Cristina Vaamonde",Vacu Vin

Key to its high performance is a three-ply, bonded construction. Sandwiched between layers of stainless steel is a thick core of pure aluminum that spreads heat evenly across the bottoms of pots and pans and all the way up the sides. The interior is highly polished 18/10 stainless steel, so it's stick-resistant as well as stain- and corrosion-resistant. The exterior is made of gleaming, magnetic stainless steel that works on induction as well as conventional stovetops, and, with care, remains beautiful during this cookware's lifetime warranty against defects--and beyond.This nine-piece set of Stainless cookware consists of a 10-inch fry pan with a layer of scratch-resistant, professional-grade nonstick coating bonded to the interior steel layer; a 2-quart covered saucepan; a 3-quart covered saucepan; a 3-quart covered saut&#xE9; pan; and a 6-quart covered stockpot. Polished 18/10 stainless-steel pan and lid handles are riveted for strength and grooved on the top for comfort. Both the lids' handles and the pans' long handles (holed for hanging on hooks or pegs) stay cool on the stovetop but won't be harmed by an oven's highest heat, although the nonstick pan should not be in an oven hotter than 400 degrees F. This Stainless cookware is dishwasher-safe, but hand washing is recommended, and it's essential for the nonstick pan.--Fred BrackWhat's in the Box10-inch fry pan, 2-quart covered saucepan, 3-quart covered saucepan, 3-quart covered saut&#xE9; pan, 6-quart covered stockpotFrom the ManufacturerAll-Clad Stainless ConstructionEach piece of All-Clad cookware features a unique metal bonding construction. All-Clad Stainless cookware sandwiches a thick core of three separate layers of aluminum between an easy-to-clean, highly polished 18/10 stainless-steel cooking surface and a magnetic stainless-steel exterior. The aluminum core retains heat and evenly distributes it along the bottom and up the sidewalls of the cookware. The stainless interior is stick-resistant and cleans easily. The magnetic stainless-steel exterior gives the cookware a gleaming finish. All-Clad Stainless also features the company&#x92;s signature ""stay-cool"" long handles, lids fashioned from gleaming 18/10 stainless steel, and highly durable stainless-steel rivets.

Designed to work on conventional gas and electric ranges, as well as induction cooktops, All-Clad Stainless cookware is the best-selling collection in a full line that includes All-Clad LTD, Cop-R-Chef, Master Chef 2, and Copper Core.Features and BenefitsAll-Clad pans with a stainless interior cooking surface are oven-safe up to 500 degrees. All-Clad pans with a non-stick cooking surface are oven-safe up to 400 degrees, but should not be used under the broiler. We recommend using a low to medium temperature when cooking with All-Clad. Higher heats are not necessary and may cause discoloration (see cleaning instructions below). Other features include:Beautifully polished, magnetic stainless exterior layer.Pure aluminum core that not only covers the bottom of the pan but also extends up the sides. This allows for great heat conductivity as well as an even heat distribution so you won&#x92;t have ""hot spots"" when cooking.Stainless-steel interior layer/cooking surface.Long, polished stainless, stay-cool handles.Sturdy, non-corrosive stainless-steel rivets won't react with foods.Polished stainless-steel lids fit evenly with the pan&#x92;s edges to seal in flavor of your foods.The All-Clad Stainless collection is compatible with an induction stovetop (with the exception of a few pieces) in addition to gas and electric stovetops.The Stainless collection is dishwasher-safe, excluding pieces with a nonstick cooking surface.WarrantyFrom date of purchase, All-Clad guarantees to repair or replace any item found defective in material, construction or workmanship under normal use and following care instructions. This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal.Cleaning InstructionsFor daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend. To use the Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keeper&#x92;s Friend to remove it.All-Clad Stainless SelectionIn recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack.

Norpro has created the ultimate apple peeler, solidly constructed and designed for years of use. It pares, cores, and slices any apple in seconds--almost automatically. All you have to do is place the apple in the machine, turn the crank, and watch the skin disappear. The coring shaft is made of carbon steel with nickel plating, and is engineered to turn smoothly and never warp, ensuring a more efficient, faster, more uniform slicing-and-peeling process. The prong fork is durable, heavy-duty nickel-plated zinc, and easily pushes the flesh of an apple to prepare it for paring. The paring blade is stainless steel, and can be adjusted for thickness by the simple loosening of a thumbscrew. Spring tension on the paring arm gradually adjusts to every contour of the apple, which allows the blade to peel smoothly and uniformly. The entire machine is set on a heavy-duty vacuum base that ""sticks"" to any smooth surface with the flip of a lever, so you can literally operate it with one hand once you set the apple in the machine. It has a number of sharp blades on it, so it's not something to be used by children without close supervision, but for an adult it's quite safe and easy to use.--Jonathon Tudor",Norpro

The clear plastic prep bowl locks into place with a  simple twist, while the blades can be set sharp side up for chopping  onions or grating Parmesan cheese, or turned blunt side up for making  walnut pesto or whipping up chocolate frosting. The set includes a  spatula and a cleaning brush for removing coffee grounds.For best results, cut ingredients into small, even pieces--about  1/2 inch square or so works well. In general, use the sharp-edge approach  for low speed and the blunt side of the blades for high speed. If you  need to run the motor for longer than one minute, pause and begin  again. The bowl, cover, and blade assembly can all be run through the  dishwasher, but watch your fingers when disassembling the machine, as  the blades are extremely sharp.--Irene SveteEditor's note: This is a reconditioned small appliance.

The glass carafe on this Chambord model holds a maximum of 48 ounces or 12 cups of brewed coffee or tea, making it a useful size for entertaining or for all-day-long drinkers.

Replacement parts are available from the manufacturer.--Cristina VaamondeFrom the ManufacturerWhen Bodum took over a small clarinet factory in Normandy in 1982, it was not because of the fine orchestra clarinets they were producing. In addition to musical instruments, the factory also produced the coffee of a relatively unknown brewer called ""The Chambord."" Bodum combined the skills of these Normandy craftspeople with modern production. The result was a unique culinary tool, affordable to the many who loved the taste of what we now know as French press coffee.Thanks to Bodum, and thanks to the increasing need for better coffee, the French press coffeemaker has become one of the most popular in the world. Yet the design has not strayed a bit from the original drawings, and Bodum still makes the Chambord with the same painstaking care and knowledge they gained from those Normandy craftspeople years ago. The ease of brewing and the delicious smell and taste of French-roasted dark coffee have remained unchanged.Awards and AccoladesIn 2004 the Bodum Chambord coffee press received the American Culinary Institute's award for best French press coffeemaker.The American Culinary Institute judges food preparation products such as mixers, waffle makers, and electric teakettles. These products are judged on criteria important to consumers such as ease of use, safety, and the quality of the food produced. The institute also judges food preparation products used in restaurants and hotels, including institutional mixers, large-volume coffee machines, and food slicers.Instructions for Use1. Place pot on a dry, flat, nonslip surface. Hold handle firmly, then pull the plunger straight up and out of the pot.2. For each 1.25-deciliter/4-ounce cup, put 1 rounded tablespoon or 1 Bodum scoop of coarse-ground coffee into the pot.Caution:Use only coarse-ground coffee. Fine grind can clog the filter and create high pressure. Place coffeemaker on a heatproof, nonslip surface.3. Pour hot (not boiling) water into the pot. Leave a minimum of 2.5 centimeters/1 inch of space at the top. Stir the brew with a plastic spoon.Caution:Metal spoons can scratch or chip the glass beaker and cause breakage.4. Place the plunger unit on top of the pot. Turn lid to close off the pour spout opening. (Does not apply to the Brazil models.) Do not press down. Let the coffee brew for at least 4 minutes.5. Hold the pot handle firmly, with the spout turned away from you, then using just the weight of your hand, apply slight pressure on top of the knob to lower the plunger straight down into the pot. Lowering the plunger slowly with minimal pressure produces best results. If the filter clogs or it becomes difficult to push down the plunger you should remove the plunger from the pot, stir the brew, and then slowly plunge again.WARNING:Using excessive force can cause scalding liquid to shoot out of the pot.6. Turn the lid to open the pour spout and then pour coffee.7. Unscrew the filter assembly and clean the plunger unit after each use. All parts are dishwasher-safe.Safety InstructionsNot for stovetop use.Check glass beaker for scratches, cracks, or chips. Do not use a pot that is scratched, chipped, or cracked. Install a replacement beaker before using the pot again.Keep children away while using. Hot water is a hazard to small children!Do not allow children to use this coffeemaker.Scald HazardExcessive plunging force can cause scalding hot liquid to shoot out of pot.Do not plunge with force.Turn lid to close spout.Use only coarse-ground coffee.Company HistoryIn 1944 Peter Bodum, the father of today's owner, Joergen Bodum, started Bodum in Copenhagen. Times were difficult at the end of World War II; there was hardly any trade and people were out of work. Peter Bodum managed to wholesale a very small variety of housewares products by Danish manufacturers.After the war Peter Bodum got an import license for kitchen and tabletop products; he traveled all over Europe and ended up importing kitchen and housewares to Denmark. As in the rest of Europe in those days, a lack of products in Denmark meant a market existed for almost anything to be sold. He specialized in glassware from Eastern Europe.In the '50s Peter Bodum started developing his own products. He collaborated with the Danish architect Kaas Klaeson for a range of coffeemakers. At the time, industrial-design-type kitchen products were very rare. The first Bodum product to hit the market in 1958 was the Santos coffeemaker--based on a vacuum coffee brewing system. It became an instant sensation not only in Denmark but in all of Europe. Bodum still produces the original Santos design to this very day.Bodum grew steadily during the '60s, but sadly, in 1967, at the age of only 57, Peter Bodum passed away. His wife managed the company until 1974, when she offered her 26-year-old son Joergen to join her in the management of the company. Joergen quickly brought on board Carsten Joergensen--then a teacher at the Danish School of Art in Copenhagen--and soon put him in charge of overall design for Bodum, including everything from products to corporate design, exhibitions, shops, buildings, catalogs, and advertising. It turned out to be a very long and fruitful collaboration. The two men began to fulfill Bodum's credo--""good design doesn't have to be expensive""--in lots of different ways.In 1974 the first fruit of Joergen and Carsten's collaboration was introduced: the French coffee press Bistro. It was also the first incorporation of the new Bodum design language--beautiful simplicity and excellent materials for everyday life. Many more variations of coffee presses followed. Since 1974, Bodum has produced over 50 million French presses, taken the leap from ""coffee"" to ""kitchen,"" and developed and produced a large variety of beautiful household and tabletop designs.In 1979, when he took over the company, Joergen Bodum decided to move to Switzerland in order to be more centrally located in Europe. He chose the Lucerne area, where Bodum's head office has been located since the early '80s.In 1980 Bodum Switzerland and its design unit, Pi-Design, were founded. Then, in 1986, the opening of Bodum's first shop in London marked another milestone in the Bodum history. It was designed not only to be the perfect showcase for the large variety of Bodum products but to embody an even stronger presentation of Bodum as an international brand. Many more shops in many more cities all over the world followed: Paris, Copenhagen, Zurich, Lucerne, Tokyo, New York, Dallas, Okinawa, Auckland, and many more. To this day there are 52 Bodum stores worldwide.With more and more of its own stores in place, Bodum continued broadening its collection of beautifully designed everyday life products--from kitchen to home. Today Bodum offers its customers everything from the latest coffee- and tea-making products to tabletop, kitchen, storage, textiles, bathroom, and home office products. Some stores also have a caf&#233; where Bodum's own selection of coffees and teas are served.The Bodum Group is, and always has been, a 100 percent family-owned business. Today the company operates in 14 different countries with over 700 employees worldwide. Bodum has holding companies in Denmark and Switzerland as well as 12 sales companies, 3 production companies, and a design company called Bodum Design Group, located in Switzerland.",Bodum

The glasses provide an exceptionally wide evaporation  surface, thereby intensifying wines' bouquet and silky texture. The  glasses are machine-blown of 24 percent lead crystal and conform to  Riedel's exacting standards: colorless, transparent, and thin-walled,  with lips cut and polished so wine flows smoothly onto the tongue.  These glasses are 9-3/4 inches high and hold 30-3/8 ounces.Though glasses shaped and sized for different types of wine seem  commonplace today, when Riedel introduced this idea in 1961 it was  revolutionary. Since then Riedel has continued fine-tuning glasses to  bring out the best characteristics in wines and spirits. Varying bowls'  shapes and sizes affects the position of the head when sipping and  where wine first contacts the tongue's various taste zones. Riedel  crystal is used by fine restaurants all over the world and thus must  stand up to frequent trips through a dishwasher.

However, it offers cooks many advantages long  before cleanup time. Constructed of extra-thick aluminum, these heavy  pots and pans conduct heat quickly and uniformly (no hot spots) and  won't warp. Their handsome, charcoal-gray exterior is harder than steel  and resists scratching and denting. Inside, they're coated with  DuPont's exceptionally durable Autograph nonstick that readily releases  food. Stainless-steel handles have an attractive satin-finish. The  handles are rounded for comfort, hollow to stay cool on the stovetop,  oven-safe to 500 degrees F, and have hanging holes. This 12-inch stir- fry pan has a helper handle and a rounded bottom that's perfect for  cooking Asian-style food.Unlike conventional hard-anodized pots and pans, this cookware is  dishwasher-safe because its titanium-composite exterior is nonporous.  Nevertheless, its virtue of being dishwasher-safe is not unlimited. To  prevent pots and pans from discoloring in a dishwasher over time--and  to prevent voiding the lifetime warranty against defects--the  manufacturer's cleaning instructions about water temperature (120 to  140 degrees F) and detergent (mild, with a phosphate content less that  7-1/2 percent) must be strictly observed. As with most cookware, hand  washing Anolon Titanium is the better alternative for ideal care.--Fred Brack",Anolon

As a result, one can quickly view the contents and choose the salt or pepper. The difference between the two mills lies in the grinding mechanism. Peugeot pepper mills use case-hardened-steel grinding heads with two sizes of grooves; the larger grooves crack the peppercorns in half and direct them into the smaller grooves, which grind them much more finely than most mills. The grinding mechanism in Peugeot salt mills is purposefully constructed with 18/10 stainless-steel, which won't corrode from prolonged contact with the salt. The top of each mill unscrews for adding peppercorns and salt, while the round ball nut can be loosened or tightened to vary the coarseness of the grind.Nancy pepper and salt mills, available in a range of sizes, make exceptional gifts individually or as a set. Peugeot has been a leading manufacturer of pepper mills since the 1840s, and is a brand preferred by many restaurants and chefs.

As a result, one can quickly view the contents and choose the salt or pepper. The difference between the two mills lies in the grinding mechanism. Peugeot pepper mills use case-hardened-steel grinding heads with two sizes of grooves; the larger grooves crack the peppercorns in half and direct them into the smaller grooves, which grind them much more finely than most mills. The grinding mechanism in Peugeot salt mills is purposefully constructed with 18/10 stainless-steel, which won't corrode from prolonged contact with the salt. The top of each mill unscrews for adding peppercorns and salt, while the round ball nut can be loosened or tightened to vary the coarseness of the grind.Nancy pepper and salt mills, available in a range of sizes, make exceptional gifts individually or as a set. Peugeot has been a leading manufacturer of pepper mills since the 1840s, and is a brand preferred by many restaurants and chefs. Care for a mill is easy: clean the exterior and inner chamber with a damp cloth; never immerse in water; avoid putting salt in the pepper mill, or grinding green or pink peppercorns by themselves (mixed with black is fine); and avoid damp types of salt (usually pink or gray) in the regular salt mill.

Because this tool's chrome/vanadium  stainless-steel rod contains hundreds of thousands of diamond  particles, it's hard enough to somewhat sharpen a blade. Using this  steel won't replace a professional sharpening job, which proceeds from  coarse grinding to ever-finer grinding at tightly controlled angles.  However, it will lengthen intervals between sharpenings better than a  steel without diamonds because it accomplishes the final task of a  professional sharpening, which is polishing the edge to a fine  point.Exceptionally well made, this tool's rod has a solid core and has been  plated with hard chrome for additional resistance to abrasion and to  extend its life. Because the rod is a 3/4-inch-wide oval, it exposes  more surface and works quicker than a cylindrical rod. Like Global's  signature knife handles, the steel's handle is molded for comfort and  dimpled for a safe grip. The rule is that a steel should be at least as  long as the knife blade being drawn across it, and this steel's 10-inch  rod is long enough for most household knives.--Fred Brack",Global

Because this tool's rod contains  microcrystalline diamonds bonded with nickel to an oval steel shaft,  it's hard enough to somewhat sharpen a blade. Using this steel won't  replace a professional sharpening job, which proceeds from coarse  grinding to ever-finer grinding at tightly controlled angles. However,  it will lengthen intervals between sharpenings better than a steel  without diamonds because it accomplishes the final task of a  professional sharpening, which is polishing the edge with its 600-grit  mesh to a fine point.The rule is that a steel should be at least as long as the knife blade  being drawn across it, and this steel's 10-inch rod is long enough for  most household knives. (Overall the tool is 15-1/4 inches long.)  Lightweight and durable, the tool has a rugged plastic handle with a  hanging hole, can be used for serrated knives as well as straight-edge  blades, and also is useful for filing glass, crystal, and china.--Fred Brack",The Ultimate Edge

Our Roasters offer unsurpassed cooking performance. One of the most important essentials for good roasting is even heating. With our Roasters, heat is spread gently and evenly providing golden roasted potatoes and a crisp and light pastry every time. The wide, shallow shape of these pieces exposes the maximum surface area of the food to the heat source, whether it be all around heat in the oven or under the broiler. They can also be used on the stovetop for frying. For best results, in cooking roast meats, poultry or poaching fish the dish should be filled almost to the brim, so the top browns and crisps quickly, leaving the food beneath moist. These dishes are ideal for making pasta dishes such as lasagna and baking delicious pies and desserts such as fruit cake and gingerbread. Great for pastry, the cast iron spreads the heat evenly and well with no soggy middles to pies or tarts. Also excellent for marinating - the surface will not spoil or discolor.

Yes, it mixes, kneads, rises, and bakes bread in three loaf sizes up to 2-1/2 pounds. But its digital controls go much further, offering settings for white, whole wheat, multigrain, and French (crisp crust, open texture) breads, each made according to what's best for that particular style. Other settings permit rapid baking and baking sandwich bread with a soft crust. For raisin (or other dried-fruit) bread, a beeper signals when to add the fruit so it's not crushed during kneading. Crust color--dark or light--can be selected as well.The machine automatically adds yeast at the proper time from a dispenser on the unit's lid. It also bakes non-yeast, quick breads-- like banana and gingerbread--and sweet cakes. And it mixes, kneads, and rises doughs for pizza, focaccia, croissants, and other pastries without baking them. A timer permits the machine to be programmed up to 13 hours in advance so fresh bread or cake is available for breakfast or dinner. For cleanup convenience, the baking pan is nonstick. Clad in metal and packing 550 watts of power, the machine measures 14 inches wide, 13.5 inches high, and 9 inches deep. Its instruction booklet is exceptionally easy to understand and includes recipes for 40 breads and doughs along with an insightful guide to baking basics and illustrated tips for making pastries.--Fred BrackFrom the ManufacturerThere's nothing quite like the warm aroma of freshly baked homemade bread from the oven. With the help of this user-friendly bread machine, even those with a busy, on-the-go schedule can enjoy this simple pleasure--without the time-consuming hard work normally associated with baking bread. Just add ingredients, press a few buttons, and it takes care of the rest.Soft-touch control panel with LCD digital display and 13-hour preset timer.Easily Bake Bread or Create DoughBake loaves of white or whole wheat bread for slicing and slathering with butter and jam or for making sandwiches. Create croissant or pizza dough for shaping by hand and baking in the oven. Make the classic fruitcake to serve during the holidays. From basic recipes to custom creations, the bread machine produces delicious results--and without the additives and preservatives found in store-bought brands. A recipe book with over 50 original bread and dough recipes comes included.Customizable SettingsThe unit's top-access, soft-touch, push-button control panel with an LCD digital display helps ensure easy programming. Choose from three different loaf sizes (medium, large, or extra large) and the crust color (light, medium, or dark). It also offers up to six different types of bread or dough options--Basic, Whole Wheat, Multi-Grain, French, Pizza, and Cake. Baking modes include Bake Only (great for fruitcakes, gingerbread, and teacakes); Rapid Bake (reduces the baking time of basic and whole-wheat breads); Raisin (offers an audible beep to signal when to add raisins, dried fruits, or nuts into the dough); and Sandwich (produces bread with a soft crust). Dough modes include Pizza, Rolls, and Raisin Dough. Best of all, the appliance comes equipped with a digital timer, which can be set up to 13 hours in advance--great for waking up to the smell of freshly baked bread. Or set the timer before leaving for work in the morning so that a warm loaf will be ready and waiting after a long day at the office. Simply slice it up and serve with dinner.Choose from 3 loaf sizes and 3 crust shades from light to dark.Healthy and NutritiousBaking bread at home allows for ultimate control over the finished product. By using only the freshest ingredients and making choices between a variety of options, homemade bread can be an important part of a well-balanced diet--for both young and older family members alike. High in fiber and low in fat, bread contains a wealth of beneficial components. It provides complex carbohydrates needed for energy, protein for strong muscles, and vitamins and minerals, including calcium and iron for healthy bones and teeth. Add nutrient-rich eggs to the recipe or choose whole-grain flour for an extra boost of fiber, iron, vitamins, and minerals. Mixing in nuts and dried fruits not only add to the pleasing consistency and taste of the finished product, but they're also another way to add to the overall health factor.Yeast dispenser automatically adds yeast at optimal time to ensure perfect results.Ultimate ConvenienceThoughtfully designed, the bread machine also supplies a YeastPro automatic yeast dispenser. Just add a measured amount of yeast into the holder on the unit's lid, and the machine will automatically dispense the yeast in with the other ingredients at the perfect time for optimal results. Even more, the unit's inner bake pan comes fitted with a wire handle (use an oven mitt when hot) for easily removing it from the appliance when the bread has finished baking. The pan's nonstick coating allows baked bread to slide easily out of the pan onto a cutting board or a wire rack to fully cool for easier slicing.Inner bake pan offers built-in handle and nonstick coating for effortless bread removal.Unique Design for Professional ResultsUnlike other bread machines, the unit does not offer a viewing window. The absence of a viewing window allows a more even reflection of heat inside the unit, which offers the following three advantages: excellent crust, good rising, and even color. The machine also benefits from a unique temperature-control program that automatically optimizes the temperatures and times for each stage of the process. Its comprehensive microprocessor program makes slight adjustments as needed to ensure perfectly baked bread regardless of conditions like climate and room temperature.Panasonic delivers excellent results regardless of different types of ingredients used, different seasons, and different room temperatures.In addition to the recipe book, accessories include a measuring spoon, a measuring cup, and a kneading blade that fits onto the base of the inner pan for thoroughly mixing ingredients. Other highlights include a top-loading locking lid, a handy indicator light to show when the baking or dough cycle has completed, a safety fuse for peace of mind, and power-interruption protection that allows the baking process to resume even when there's an interruption in power for approximately 10 minutes or less. All parts should be hand washed only. The small appliance comes in a compact design that fits neatly on the kitchen countertop.

This jar sealer attachment fits on wide-mouth mason jars and is for use with any FoodSaver machine that has an accessory port. The top forms a tight seal on mason jars while the tubing removes air from the jar with the help of a FoodSaver machine. The jar sealer works equally as well in packaging liquid foods, such as jams or chocolate sauces, as it does for dry goods, such as brown sugar or spices. While vacuum packaging is not a substitute for traditional canning methods, it does keep food fresh three to five times longer than keeping it in a plastic food storage container in the refrigerator.

Putting an end to the oxidation process, which turns a favorite Merlot into vinegar, is easy with the Vacu Vin Concerto Wine Saver. These long-lasting extra stoppers are designed to work with the vacuum-style pump (sold separately) to keep a wine fresh. Made of high-quality rubber, they won't affect the taste of the wine. And the method is simple--just place a stopper in the opening of a bottle, place the pump over the stopper, and pump air out until the pump clicks to indicate that the correct vacuum level has been attained. This process is suitable for preserving all but sparkling wines, and will save Chiantis, Syrahs, and others for up to two weeks.--Madeleine Miller",Vacu Vin

(It won't work with  sparkling wines or soft drinks, however.) A simple and ingenious pump fits onto one of  the two bottle stoppers that come with the set and pumps the air from a bottle through the  stopper, which then seals the resulting vacuum. For precision, the pump clicks when the  correct vacuum level has been attained. With no oxygen inside the bottle to turn wine  vinegary it stays fresh until the stopper is removed. The matte-black pump and gray  stoppers fit onto a stable, shiny black storage base and look elegant as a top hat on the  bar.

Each miniature shaker is designed in a cylindrical shape out of swirled glass and stands about 3 inches tall with a slim 1/2-inch diameter. The screw-on lids are made of stainless steel to avoid staining or pitting from the salt. The shakers rest within a bed of grape leaves on a hand-crafted stand, which also features detailed bunches of grapes and a branch for a handle. The brilliant luster of the stand captures the elegance of antique silver; however, it is actually made of hand-polished aluminum, which is much easier for today's busy hostesses to maintain. The stand is not dishwasher-safe but cleans easily with mild soap and water--and, because the shakers are breakable, it is advisable to wash them by hand as well.

Waterford has been making renowned crystal pieces for more than 200 years and has named many of its patterns after towns in Waterford and other neighboring counties. The Lismore design features repeating leaf motifs for a lively, natural look.Small 16-rayed stars are cut into the underside of the bases of both bowl and creamer. Lismore's signature elongated leaf cuts alternate in an up-and-down ring above a scintillating ring of diamond wedge cuts. The creamer's swan's-neck handle is flanked by two especially long cuts for a pleasing symmetry. With the exception of the creamer's pouring spout, the upper rims are smoothly squared off. The set would make a beautiful grouping with the elegant Lismore sandwich tray and biscuit barrel; other serving pieces in the Lismore series include a pitcher, a carafe, and square and pedestal bowls.To preserve their clarity, wash the sugar bowl and creamer with a mild liquid soap and warm (not hot) water; do not wash in dishwasher as this may permanently etch surface of crystal. Certain water may leave a lime or mineral deposit on the crystal; if that happens, vinegar on a soft, nonabrasive cloth will help remove the deposit. Rinse with warm water and polish with a lint-free cloth. Do not store upside down on the rims or stand on rims on a draining board. Crystal can focus sunlight into a concentrated beam that could potentially scorch rugs or furniture, so do not store or display in direct sunlight. The sugar bowl measures 4 by 4 inches; the creamer is 4-1/2-inches tall and 4-1/2 inches wide, spout to handle.--Garland Withers",Waterford Crystal

Part of W&#xFC;sthof's Gourmet series of  knives, this 8-inch fillet knife is a less expensive version of the  knives in the manufacturer's Classic series. Although the blade is  still made of high-carbon steel with a stain-resistant alloy, the  difference is that the blade is a thinner quality metal and is cut by a  precision laser instead of by hand. The blade still has an ideal shape  as it is ground and polished by computer to ensure perfect tapering  from tip to bolster. Full tangs extend through the synthetic  traditional-style handles, which are triple-riveted for strength. This  knife is dishwasher-safe but hand washing is recommended to preserve  the edge on the blade.

Waterford has been making renowned crystal pieces for more than 200 years, and the centuries of craftsmanship are clearly displayed in this series inspired by the seahorse, a creature with ancient, mythical significance. The Seahorse pattern is based on the crest adopted more than a decade ago to represent the Irish seaside location of the Waterford company.The sides of this mid-sized vase are festooned with swirling wedge cuts, punctuated with smaller olive cuts for a sense of upward motion. Between the wedges are fields of raised diamond shapes, with modified rosettes encircling the smooth rim of the bowl to symbolize the trident of Neptune, Roman god of the sea. A large 16-rayed star is cut into the pedestal base of the vase. The Seahorse 10-inch vase is a good size for dahlias, roses, chrysanthemums, and other medium-stemmed flowers.To preserve its clarity, wash the vase with mild liquid soap and warm (not hot) water; do not wash in dishwasher as this may permanently etch surface of crystal. Rinse with warm water and polish with a lint-free cloth. Certain water may leave a lime or mineral deposit on the crystal; if that happens, vinegar on a soft, nonabrasive cloth will help remove the deposit. Do not store upside down on its rim or stand on its rim on a draining board. Crystal can focus sunlight into a concentrated beam that could potentially scorch rugs or furniture, so do not store or display in direct sunlight. The vase stands 10 inches tall and has a 6-1/4-inch diameter; the base is 4-1/2 inches wide.--Garland Withers",Waterford Crystal

All-Clad pans with a non-stick cooking surface are oven-safe up to 400 degrees, but should not be used under the broiler. We recommend using a low to medium temperature when cooking with All-Clad. Higher heats are not necessary and may cause discoloration (see cleaning instructions below). Other features include:Beautifully polished, stainless exterior layer.Pure aluminum core that not only covers the bottom of the pan but also extends up the sides. This allows for great heat conductivity as well as an even heat distribution so you won&rsquo;t have ""hot spots"" when cooking.Stainless-steel interior layer/cooking surface.Long, polished stainless, stay-cool handles.Sturdy, non-corrosive stainless-steel rivets won't react with foods.Polished stainless-steel lids fit evenly with the pan&rsquo;s edges to seal in flavor of your foods.The Stainless collection is dishwasher-safe, excluding pieces with a nonstick cooking surface.WarrantyFrom date of purchase, All-Clad guarantees to repair or replace any item found defective in material, construction or workmanship under normal use and following care instructions. This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal.Cleaning InstructionsFor daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keeper&rsquo;s Friend. To use the Bar Keeper&rsquo;s Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keeper&rsquo;s Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keeper&rsquo;s Friend to remove it.All-Clad Stainless SelectionIn recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack.

The VH2 not only generates heat but circulates it throughout the entire room. This whole room heater has a simple to use turn-dial thermostatic temperature control knob. Simply heat the room to a comfortable level and then turn the dial back until the heater shuts off. The Vortex Heater will then maintain that temperature within 3 to 4 degrees. This household heater is whisper-quiet and has advanced safety features cool-touch exterior, automatic tip-over and over-heat protection to provide worry-free use. The Vornado VH2 was a Good Housekeeping Research Institute top safety pick in the Feb. 2008 issue. Vornado Energy Efficient Whole Room Heaters are different from traditional space heaters. Vornado portable space heaters are more energy efficient thanks to unique vortex action which disburse heat evenly throughout the room. This more efficient movement of air saves energy, allowing the Vornado electric heater to warm an entire room in less time! Most ordinary space heaters heat the space directly in front of the heater leaving the rest of the room cold, which contributes to running heaters longer and at higher temperatures and using more energy.

The nonstick surface ensures that food lifts off the griddle effortlessly and that cleanup is easy. A built-in ledge around the entire griddle surface provides a backstop for flipping pancakes or eggs, and a drip tray beneath the griddle catches grease from bacon or other meats and slides out easily for emptying.

And it's easy to cook healthfully with pressure cookers, since the food retains so much more of its nutrients and flavor.

This durable, polished-aluminum pressure cooker is an economical addition to any well-rounded set of kitchen tools.The heavy-duty lid locks down during cooking; an inner sealing ring keeps the steam in. In addition to a pop-up pressure indicator and a simple steam release mechanism, there is an overpressure plug that will let off steam if it builds up excessively. This pressure cooker is useful for weeknight dinners or for any meal that needs to come together quickly. An accompanying booklet contains more than 65 recipes, ranging from basic soup stocks to stews and pot roast--even desserts like Oatmeal-Apple Crisp! Tenderize lean cuts of beef or pork; or cook chicken, fish, or vegetables faster than you can in a microwave, and without losing moisture.Nonabrasive cleansers are best for cleaning this polished aluminum pressure cooker, though occasional use of a fine metal polish will help the exterior keep its shine.
