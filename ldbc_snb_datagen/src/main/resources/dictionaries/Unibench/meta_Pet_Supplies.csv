New users should be mindful about selecting this book over a more introductory-level text, because it dedicates only one chapter to using the basic tools of QuarkXPress 4, including image importing, file creation, and rudimentary page setup configurations.Divided into three parts, this book treats intermediate to advanced users to fairly rich discussions of QuarkXPress 4's graphics and text tools. In addition, it covers a multitude of XTensions (third-party add-ons), and QuarkImmedia, a Quark-produced multimedia document authoring tool.True to itsIn Depthclaim, this book plumbs the farthest extent of the software's capabilities. For example, chapter 10, which focuses on the management of ""Long Documents,"" begins with a logistics checklist that outlines crucial elements of the design process, including the delegation of authority and the overall organization of the project. Once these preliminary tasks are completed, the chapter launches into the technical procedures required for managing the document using QuarkXPress tools such as its book palette, which allows for the combination and consolidation of multiple small documents, creating lists, and constructing an index using each of the indexing tool's features.Though the book includes a special, full-color section, the images selected can often be puzzling. Why waste full-color plates on a cyan, magenta, yellow, and black layering example that appears out of context with the examples from the brochure tutorial? And why would it be necessary to include full-color screen shots of color dialog boxes rather than better visual demonstrations of the software's layout capabilities? Aside from this unnecessary attempt at adding bells and whistles, though, the book does a decent job of addressing the software's more complex attributes.--Ryan Kuykendall",Dean &amp; Tyler

They also offer detailed advice on using the various tools to achieve just the sort of look you want, whether you're cleaning up and color correcting an old, tattered photo that you've scanned in, or creating a fantastic piece of art.There are plenty of step-by-step instructions in the book's projects, and you work through these using the files on the included CD-ROM. A ""Moving On"" section sums up each chapter and explains how the next chapter will further your knowledge of Photoshop. A full-color section in the middle of the book shows a few of the project images, as well as images that have been altered via filters, masking techniques, and color-correcting options. Helpful illustrations and shortcut tips pepper the book.

Made from the same super-tough, puncture-resistant natural rubber as classic Kongs, its patented grooved design ""squeegees"" teeth and gums clean as dogs chew, helping prevent plaque and tartar buildup (not to mention bad breath). Use Kong Breath Paste inside the grooves to motivate your dog to chew and freshen his breath at the same time. Shaped like a bone, Kong dental toys have a hollow interior just made for stuffing with treats or biscuits. Extracting the contents is work that can keep dogs happy and busy for hours, helping prevent boredom, separation anxiety, and related behavior problems like barking, digging, or chewing shoes. Measuring 6-1/2 inches long, the extra-large size is intended for dogs weighing more than 50 pounds, from German shepherds on up to mastiffs and Saint Bernards.

Like their human owners, many pets have sensitive skin that reacts adversely to chemical treatment, breaking out into rashes, burning, and even developing more dander. Dander-Out offers a chemical- free cleaner for greater pet, and planet, comfort. With all-natural ingredients, the spray gently removes dander while deodorizing the pet&#146;s body. Additionally, the spray can be used on owner clothes and some skin to eradicate the household pet&#146;s dander and aroma after close contact.The pet dander remover and deodorizer uses a simple formula of water, alcohol drawn from corn, biodegradable surfactant taken from coconuts, lemon oil, and, most importantly, natural enzymes. Like the enzymes that break up food inside the human body, the enzymes in the Dander-Out formula absorb and process pet dander and residual odors. To use, spray the formula on a clean cloth and wipe dander and impurities away from a pet&#146;s coat. Likewise, use a clean towel when applying Dander-Out to human clothes and skin, taking care to avoid the face and eyes. Some individuals with sensitive skin may find that the spray causes inflammation. In the event of prolonged skin inflammation or ingestion of the spray, this product suggests consulting a physician. For spray in the eyes, rinse well with cool, clean water. In creating Dander-Out, no animal byproducts were used and animal testing was not employed. Dander-Out is a non-toxic, biodegradable product and comes in recyclable packaging to promote resource awareness. These products offers a money back guarantee for insufficient dander and odor removal. The bottle contains 22 fluid ounces and weights 1-1/2 pounds upon shipping. Please read all label information with care upon delivery.--Jessica ReulingLabel InformationIngredientsWater, Enzymes, Alcohol (Derived From Corn), Biodegradeable Surfactant (Derived from Coconut) (Does not contain SLS), Lemon Oil.WarningsPlease read all label information with care upon delivery.

Vitamin E (tocopherols) is actually a family of compounds, and based on their chemical structure they are known as alpha, beta, delpha, and gamma Vitamin E. Vitamin E can not be produced by humans, cats, dogs, etc. thus it must come from dietary sources.

The answer? Put your dog to work. That Lab may look sweet, but he's a natural born killer, genetically evolved to forage, hunt, chase, and gnaw. When those natural urges are frustrated, he may develop problem behaviors like barking, digging, and yes, chewing shoes. Kong biscuit balls turn passive feeding into active play sessions that satisfy a dog's psychological and intellectual needs as well as his nutritional ones. Made from the same super-durable natural rubber as the classic Kong toy, the biscuit balls have a hollow center and four bone-shaped openings on the exterior to hold treats, bones, or dog food. This unique patented design dispenses rewards as your dog plays and chews. Use sticky foods like peanut butter or soft cheese like glue to make treats harder to remove, keeping dogs happy and busy for hours. Measuring four inches in diameter, this biscuit ball is recommended for medium- and larger-sized dogs, ranging from border collies on up to Saint Bernards. As with all Kong toys, supervision is recommended when first giving a new plaything to your dog. Regularly inspect the biscuit ball and replace if damaged. Satisfaction is guaranteed; if either you or your dog aren't happy with your purchase, return within 30 days for a full refund.--Mary Park",KONG

It will not raise pH above 8.3 even if inadvertently overdosed. Marine Buffer&#x2122; is a blended product and is not just sodium bicarbonate or sodium carbonate, commonly sold as a substitute. Such products can raise pH to dangerous levels if not used properly. Marine Buffer&#x2122; contains sodium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and potassium salts of carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride, sulfate, and borate. Total Alkalinity is a measurement of three main ions: carbonate, bicarbonate, and borate. In saltwater, bicarbonate drives the pH toward 7.8, carbonate drives pH toward 9.1, and borate toward 9.5 or more. Because of the chemistry of buffering systems, the closer you get the pH to the pK of a buffering system, the harder it is for the pH to shift. So, if you blend a buffer so that the combined product drives the pH toward 8.3, then the more you use, the more stable the pH becomes. That is the principle behind Marine Buffer&#x2122;. It is a blended buffer that drives and holds your pH at 8.3 because of the blend. The catch to this seemingly simple solution is that most salt mixes contain substantial amounts of bicarbonate salts. This shifts the pK of the buffering system further towards 7.8, and a buffer that shoots for 8.3 will never quite get there. Thus, the pK of Marine Buffer is actually slightly higher than 8.3 in order to combat the influx of bicarbonate at every water change. Marine Buffer&#x2122; was the first buffer on the market which contained borate salts (which make a saltwater buffering system much more stable).",Seachem

Undermetabolized proteins create urea and uric acid. Much like Vitamin C is very good for us, if we take too much of it, our urine will turn a bright yellow.

In the wild, a bird will hunt for all kinds of food. Flavorful foods, colorful foods, foods that are fun, even playful to eat. And, intuitively, they get the foods they need. It's a difference you'll notice, too. Your bird will thrive on the stimulation and beak exercise it provides. In fact, 96% of the berry gets eaten. Which means it's not just smart nutrition, it's a smart buy, too. And at home? They fuss, they pick and get more food on the floor than in their beaks. Consequently, they not only miss out on the joy of eating - they miss out on nutrition too. Minimum waste. Maximum nutrition. Nutri-Berries are different. They're made with savory peanuts, hulled canary seed, cracked corn and other tempting ingredients. They're colorful, richly textured and invitingly shaped.

All plants require a source of carbon. This is typically obtained from CO2, but, may also be derived from simple organic compounds (such as photosynthetic intermediates). The use of either CO2 injection or Flourish Excel&#x2122; does not necessarily negate the use of the other. Because the processes of producing photosynthetic intermediates and building onto them occur simultaneously, one can derive a substantial benefit with the use of Flourish Excel&#x2122; either alone or in conjunction with CO2 . The combination is particularly ideal for situations when continuing to add CO2 could result in dangerously low pH levels. Flourish Excel&#x2122; also has iron reducing properties which promote the ferrous state of iron (Fe+2), which is more easily utilized by plants than ferric iron (Fe+3). The reason plants need CO2 is to produce longer chain carbon compounds also known as photosynthetic intermediates. Photosynthetic intermediates includes compounds such as ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, and 2-carboxy-3-keto-D-arabinitol 1,5 bisphosphate. Although the names are complicated, the structures are quite simple (5 carbon chains). Flourish Excel&#x2122; does not contain these specific compounds per se, but one that is quite similar. By dosing with Flourish Excel&#x2122; you bypass the involvement of CO2 and introduce the already finished, structurally similar compounds. It is in its structural similarity that Flourish Excel&#x2122; is able to be utilized in the carbon chain building process of photosynthesis. Simple chemical or enzymatic steps can easily convert it to any one to any one of the above named compounds (or a variety of others).",Seachem

Prime&#xAE; will remove both chlorine and chloramines from municipal water supplies. Prime&#xAE; also contains a binder which renders ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate non-toxic. It is very important to understand how those two functions work together. All dechlorinators operate through a chemical process known as reduction. In this process, toxic dissolved chlorine gas (Cl2) is converted into non-toxic chloride ions (Cl-). The reduction process also breaks the bonds between chlorine and nitrogen atoms in the chloramine molecule (NH2Cl), freeing the chlorine atoms and replacing them with hydrogen (H) to create ammonia (NH3). Typically, dechlorinators stop there, leaving an aquarium full of toxic ammonia! Seachem takes the necessary next step by including an ammonia binder to detoxify the ammonia produced in the reduction process.",Seachem

Formaldehyde is more toxic than ammonia, and if too much is used, the results can be disastrous. Ammonia Detox is safe, even when overdosed. It neutralizes ammonia, chlorine and chloramine, instantly preparing tap water for immediate addition to the aquarium. Unlike some similar products, Ammonia Detox is even safe for sensitive hard and soft corals, anemones and other invertebrates, as well as freshwater and marine fish and plants. Use when preparing tap water for new aquariums, making water changes, or adding water to make up for evaporation. Ammonia Detox is safe to use directly in all freshwater and marine aquariums, including coral mini-reefs and also water gardens to neutralize toxic ammonia, as well. If the bacteria bed of an aquarium is accidentally killed by overuse of antibiotics, or other factors, Ammonia Detox will bind toxic ammonia, providing time to relocate the fish and invertebrates or to obtain other filtration media. In cases where too many fish are added too quickly, Ammonia Detox will bind ammonia until the existing bacteria multiply sufficiently to handle the ammonia.

Adjusting the pH to the proper level will improve fish health, disease resistance, coloration and breeding. While many common aquarium fish will live in water with a pH range of 6.8 to 7.5, a pH of 7.0 is ideal for a community aquarium containing a variety of freshwater fish. Live bearers like mollies and swordtails prefer a higher pH of 7.2-7.6. Acid-loving fish such as angelfish and neon tetras prefer a lower pH of 6.5 6.8. Each dose of pH Down neutralizes some of the carbonate hardness and lowers the pH. The pH may rebound up to the original pH if the carbonate hardness is high. Several consecutive treatments with pH Down may be necessary to lower pH, but if there are fish present in the aquarium, the pH should not be changed more than .2 in a 24 hour period. The number of doses required to lower the pH will depend on the carbonate hardness level and the desired pH level. An aquarium with low carbonate hardness may require one treatment with pH Down while an aquarium with a high carbonate level will require several.",API

It contains all the nutrients required by plants for proper development and lasting growth, while enabling growing roots to penetrate and anchor themselves firmly to the substrate. The unique porous structure of the Flora Base granules optimizes oxygen penetration and microbal propagation and allows plant nutrients to be released into the surrounding water, obviating the need to add root nutrient supplements for at least 6 months. In addition, Flora Base serves as an excellent filter media when combined with an under-gravel filter, as its granules enable it to actively absorb floating particles, removing cloudiness from the water. Flora Base acts as a pH buffer, maintaining a stable pH between 6.5 and 7.0, which is ideal for almost all aquatic plants. Each 11 lb. bag of Flora Base provides the right quantity of substrate for a 10 gallon aquarium.",Red Sea

The reason could be a deficiency of digestive enzymes.                   Veterinarians and pet nutritionists often find such deficiencies and recommend digestive enzyme supplements.

The results, according to the experts, include improved hair                     coat and skin, resistance                     to illness, vigor and mobility, and maintenance of good body                     weight.

Iodine is as toxic as chlorine and should never be used in a reef system. However, iodide is as safe as chloride. Most iodine supplements on the market are simply potassium iodide or a medicinal disinfectant commonly known as Lugol&#x2019;s Solution.

Although such products are sold for use in reef aquaria, we believe the risks vastly outweigh the potential minor benefits. Potassium iodide only products are a safer alternative but not very effective alone owing to the unstable nature of iodide in the aquarium environment. When added to an aquarium environment, iodide becomes unstable converting to elemental iodine (which is biocidal), iodate (which is useless to corals, toxic at elevated levels, and can't be tested for), and iodide which is the only form of iodine available to corals for uptake.

Calcium hydroxide is used to prepare limewater (kalkwasser) solutions that will maintain calcium concentrations at natural seawater levels. Kalkwasser solutions maintain calcium directly and carbonate alkalinity indirectly. However, its capacity to perform these functions is dependent on evaporation rate and CO2 concentration. If these two factors are insufficient you can provide additional calcium with Reef Advantage Calcium&#x2122;, Reef Complete&#xAE;, or Reef Calcium&#x2122;, and carbonate alkalinity with Reef Builder&#x2122; or Reef Carbonate&#x2122; (do not mix these directly with a kalkwasser solution).Many who use kalkwasser are quite successful with their marine systems and find it to be an effective way of maintaining calcium. However, it can be a difficult technique for the beginner to master. The carbonate alkalinity must be monitored and adjusted to ensure that it does not become depleted through chalk (calcium carbonate) precipitation. The magnesium concentration must also be monitored and maintained since precipitation of magnesium hydroxide (arising from excess hydroxyl ions) can lead to a change in the balance of the various buffer systems present which can result in drastic pH shifts. Additionally, magnesium is an essential component of seawater that is required by all corals. There will be an increase in the build up of chalk on substrate and plumbing surfaces which will require more frequent cleanings in order to maintain the proper functioning of the aquarium. If due care and diligence is paid to all of these factors, there is no reason one cannot maintain a successful reef system while using kalkwasser.

It will not raise pH above 8.3 even if inadvertently overdosed. Marine Buffer&#x2122; is a blended product and is not just sodium bicarbonate or sodium carbonate, commonly sold as a substitute. Such products can raise pH to dangerous levels if not used properly. Marine Buffer&#x2122; contains sodium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and potassium salts of carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride, sulfate, and borate. Total Alkalinity is a measurement of three main ions: carbonate, bicarbonate, and borate. In saltwater, bicarbonate drives the pH toward 7.8, carbonate drives pH toward 9.1, and borate toward 9.5 or more. Because of the chemistry of buffering systems, the closer you get the pH to the pK of a buffering system, the harder it is for the pH to shift. So, if you blend a buffer so that the combined product drives the pH toward 8.3, then the more you use, the more stable the pH becomes. That is the principle behind Marine Buffer&#x2122;. It is a blended buffer that drives and holds your pH at 8.3 because of the blend. The catch to this seemingly simple solution is that most salt mixes contain substantial amounts of bicarbonate salts. This shifts the pK of the buffering system further towards 7.8, and a buffer that shoots for 8.3 will never quite get there. Thus, the pK of Marine Buffer is actually slightly higher than 8.3 in order to combat the influx of bicarbonate at every water change.

Kalkwasser solutions maintain calcium directly and carbonate alkalinity indirectly. However, its capacity to perform these functions is dependent on evaporation rate and CO2 concentration.

However, it can be a difficult technique for the beginner to master. The carbonate alkalinity must be monitored and adjusted to ensure that it does not become depleted through chalk (calcium carbonate) precipitation. The magnesium concentration must also be monitored and maintained since precipitation of magnesium hydroxide (arising from excess hydroxyl ions) can lead to a change in the balance of the various buffer systems present which can result in drastic pH shifts. Additionally, magnesium is an essential component of seawater that is required by all corals. There will be an increase in the build up of chalk on substrate and plumbing surfaces which will require more frequent cleanings in order to maintain the proper functioning of the aquarium. If due care and diligence is paid to all of these factors, there is no reason one cannot maintain a successful reef system while using kalkwasser.

We invented the replaceable blade nail trimmer and our design is so unique it's patented. Our product is a favorite with veterinarians and groomers, yet it is affordable for pet owners. Others duplicate our product but don't meet our standards. Nail grooming is necessary and humane because most pets don't wear down their nails. Doing it once a month is a good rule. Not grooming nails regularly can cause the nails to grow so long that it is pain full for the dog to walk. And the nail can curve and in grow causing infection. Puppy's nails grow faster than adult dogs so they may need their nails trimmed more often.Replaceable Blades If the blades become dull they can be replaced with a Resco Blade Replacement PF0400 (1 blade) or PF0440 (6 blades).Unusual Uses of Resco Nail Trimmers: Trimming pet bird beaks and claws.

It's a difference you'll notice, too. Your bird will thrive on the stimulation and beak exercise it provides. In fact, 96% of the berry gets eaten. Which means it's not just smart nutrition, it's a smart buy, too. And at home? They fuss, they pick and get more food on the floor than in their beaks. Consequently, they not only miss out on the joy of eating - they miss out on nutrition too. Minimum waste. Maximum nutrition. Nutri-Berries are different. They're made with savory peanuts, hulled canary seed, cracked corn and other tempting ingredients. They're colorful, richly textured and invitingly shaped.

As a practicing veterinarian in the 1960's Dr Ted Lafeber Sr. was treating pet birds and soon realized that most pet birds were suffering from malnutrition. Birds can not survive on millet, canary seed and sunflower seeds alone. In 1975, he created the very first pet bird pellet recipe. Initially, many people thought he was crazy, birds eat seeds, not pellets, but then they saw the results the birds eating pellets were healthier, happier and living longer. Nutritionally Balanced Good health and a long life begin with proper nutrition and Lafeber' s Premium Daily Diet is formulated to provide exactly that. Lafeber' s Premium Daily Diet is a high quality blend of natural ingredients like ground non-GMO corn and soybean meal. Both grains are literally grown outside Lafeber Company's front door. We also add whole egg, the world's most digestive form of protein. The different grains are mixed and essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids are added which are necessary for strong bones and brilliant feathers. Watch your feathered friend shine with the excellent nutrition found in Lafeber' s pelleted bird food. Balancing the Omega Fatty Acids increases immune function. Generally, increased immune function helps the body's ability to fight disease. Balanced Omega 3 & 6's also improves the quality of the skin. More than ever, each pelleted recipe provides excellent nutrition for your loved feathered companion. Creating the first Omega 3 & 6 balanced pet bird pellet is just one of the reasons Lafeber Company is considered the leader in avian nutrition. Our veterinarians and nutritionist determined the best combination of natural preservatives, specifically mixed tocopherols and citric acid, to protect the nutrients of Lafeber' s Premium Daily Diet pellets. Our pellets are naturally flavored with the great taste of molasses. Molasses provides the energy birds need and a taste birds enjoy.",Lafeber
