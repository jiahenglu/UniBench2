630560875X,"Tae-Bo Workout (SET OF 4: Basic, Instructional, Advanced, 8-minute Workout) [VHS]",20.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71GPAKMB9TL._SY300_.gif,{'Movies & TV': 72299},"[['Movies & TV', 'TV'], ['Sports & Outdoors', 'Exercise & Fitness', 'Exercise Videos']]","Billed as the ""future of fitness"" and hawked by numerous celebrities, Billy Blanks's Tae-Bo actually deserves much of the hype it's receiving. A mixture of boxing punches and martial arts kicks, Tae-Bo is funandeasy. One of the best elements of this four-tape set is that the first tape (which is 40 minutes long),Tae-Bo: Instructional, lays out the movements you need to successfully complete a workout. Once you've mastered the steps, you won't have to fast-forward through half the tape to get to the workout, nor will your workout be slowed down by the repeated lessons. After you feel comfortable with the movements (and they're really quite easy to follow; nothing too complicated to trip you up), you're ready to move on toTae-Bo: Basics, a 27-minute workout (5 minutes of warm-up, 18 minutes of Tae-Bo, and 4 minutes of cool-down) that will have your heart pounding and your body sweating. Next comesAdvanced, a 57-minute workout that will have your heart racing, pulse pounding, and sweat glands working overtime. There's razzmatazz on the moves, with slightly more complicated combinations that should be fairly easy to master if you've completed the first two tapes. This video seriously raises the bar on the difficulty factor.In addition to the short warm-up, the cool-down, and the 30 minutes of Tae-Bo,Advanced Tae-Boalso includes 18 minutes of muscle-crunching floor work. You know you're in trouble when even the guys in the tape have trouble keeping up. Make sure you have truly mastered the first two tapes before attempting this one. The8-Minute Workoutis a highly compacted workout (actually 14 minutes long when you include warm-up and cool-down) for those days when you're too short on time forBasicorAdvanced. While the 8-minute idea is compelling, it's not an adequate substitute for the longer workouts. Blanks, a seven-time World Martial Arts champion, is a superb instructor, providing encouragement and careful instruction (if you don't know by the end of the tape to hold in your stomach, that's no one's fault but your own). The only downside to these tapes is the less-than-exciting music. Not only is Tae-Bo great exercise for all levels, but the punches and kicks are wonderful for working out stress and aggression. This istheaerobics exercise video for people who are bored by aerobics.--Jenny Brown",Billy Blanks

On offense, rookie quarterback Shaun King showed that heart, not experience, is what makes a player succeed. Running backs Mike Alstott and Warrick Dunn are the backbone of the Buccaneers' offense, which should improve greatly in 2000, with the addition of Pro Bowl wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson.Head coach Tony Dungy and the Buccaneers will look back at 1999 as one of the best seasons in franchise history.  They also can look ahead to a bright future.",

It's perfect for just about any frying chore and goes into the oven as a roasting pan and even as a baking pan. (It's the traditional ""skillet"" in skillet corn bread.) Because cast iron is unexcelled for retaining heat and distributing it evenly--no hot spots--foods cook uniformly in the 8-inch skillet. It's heavy, must be seasoned with melted shortening and baked, and needs to be coated with oil or cooking spray after each use to prevent rust. Though its weight and care put off some cooks, cast iron--as has been known since the Middle Ages--permits precise cooking and flavor retention, is naturally nonstick when seasoned, and lasts for generations, increasing the value of its moderate price.

This knife sharpener is remarkably easy to use on  both straight-edge and serrated knives. Simply plug it in, turn it on, and feed knife blades  through the stages. The first sharpening stage uses 100 percent diamond abrasive disks to hone the knife's edge while the second stage incorporates polymer disks to polish and strop the edge to hairsplitting sharpness.  Straight-edge knives should go through both stages, while serrated blades should only be  used in the polishing stage.The internal elastomeric spring guides hold knife blades at just the right angle to the  sharpening surfaces, making sharpening easy. The instructions are easy to follow, and  maintenance is limited to removing the metal dust shavings from the clean-out tray once  a year or so; no lubrication is necessary for the motor, bearings, or sharpening surfaces.  Guaranteed not to detemper, the sharpener has a two-year warranty for home use.--Ariel Meadow Stallings",Chef&#39;s Choice

His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a ""no light, no pay"" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark.In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.",Coleman

Renown internationally as a manufacturer of boxing equipment, Everlast started out as a swimwear manufacturer in 1910. Headquartered in the Bronx, NY, the company was founded by 17-year-old Jacob Golomb. The son of a tailor and an avid swimmer, Jacob Golomb was dissatisfied with the durability of swimsuits because they barely lasted a season, so he began making suits that he guaranteed would last for a full year. He proudly gave them the name, Everlast. Although the swimsuits did not last through the years, the name did.Over the next years, Golomb expanded his company into a small retail store that carried a full line of sports equipment. In 1917, a young fighter named Jack Dempsey introduced boxing to Golomb and Everlast. Dempsey asked Golomb to construct protective headgear that would last more than 15 rounds of intensive boxing training. Golomb specially designed the training gear for Dempsey. In 1919, Dempsey won the world's heavyweight championship wearing boxing gloves made for him by Golomb. Everlast became the headquarters for boxing equipment throughout the world. In 1925, Golomb designed elastic-waist trunks to replace the leather-belted trunks then worn by boxers. These trunks, now known as boxer trunks, immediately became famous. Jacob Golomb ran the business until he passed away in the early 1950s and his son, Dan, took over. In 1958, Ben Nadorf joined Everlast and purchased 50 percent of the company from the Golomb family. When Dan Golomb passed away in 1995, Nadorf purchased the family's remaining 50 percent interest. Nadorf remained the president and principle share holder of Everlast until Oct. 24, 2000.Everlast men's and women's apparel and accessories continue today to be tremendously successful both inside and outside the ring. In addition, Everlast boxing trunks and equipment remain the proud and undefeated champion of the boxing industry for more than 90 years. The history continues, as the name states.

The company began when MacRae Hosiery manufacturers, established by Alexander in 1914, extended the manufacture of underwear to swimwear and became MacRae Knitting Mills.

In 1929, the first swimsuits were in production and it didn&#x92;t take long for Speedo to successfully establish itself.

Ideal for playing solo or in friendship-bonding face-to-face play, Strat-O-Matic is easy to learn. Yet it is challenging enough to entertain for hours, as you make the player selections and the offensive and defensive decisions that decide the outcome. Make your lineup and in-game strategy decisions. Roll the dice that activate play (think of it as the pitch or swing). Then find the result on the statistically designed player card. Every player is unique, giving every dice roll drama. The first die tells you whether to consult the batter or pitcher card and which of his three columns to check. Two other six-sided dice are added to locate the result in the correct column. What a player does most (hit for average, hit for power, strike out, etc.) shows up on the most common dice combinations. Because of Strat-O-Matic&#x2019;s unmatched play value, a full nine innings can be played in less than 30 minutes. One dice roll ends most at-bats with the outcome right off the player card. Sometimes you&#x2019;ll need a dramatic second role &#x2013; to find out if your fielder is good enough to save a run or turn a double-play, or to find out if that long fly ball is outta here or caught at the warning track. Three games in one, Strat-O-Matic will have you playing the Basic game within minutes of opening the box. Once you have a little experience, you may wish to adventure into the richly detailed Advanced and Super Advanced games, where lefty-righty advantages, ballpark effects, clutch hitting &#x2013; and much more &#x2013; practically put you in the dugout as a Major League manager.

Thus began what would become the international brand name Victorinox, a combination of Victoria, for Elsener's mother, and ""inox,"" or stainless steel. Today, Victorinox produces watches, luggage, clothing, and, famously, Swiss Army Knives. The original product dates to 1897, when Elsener patented the Swiss Officer's and Sports Knife he supplied to the Swiss Army. Following World War II, American servicemen and women shopping in PX stores shortened the name to Swiss Army Knife, which lives on in English-speaking countries around the world and has become a metaphor for versatility.",Victorinox

Once you start opening the knife, SOG's Patented SOG Assisted Technology, or S.A.T., takes over. Through the balance of opposing high-tension coil springs in the knife, the force to propel the knife open becomes greater than the closing force, and the blade will open on its own. This unique feature means that if you are using your dominant hand on another task, you can just as easily open the FSA-98 with your other hand.For security and peace of mind, S.A.T. was developed in conjunction with a superior locking system. The unique design of S.A.T. knives allows them to use locking mechanisms that are stronger, more reliable, and easier to access ambidextrously than conventional liner locks.For Flash Series knives, this means the blade is held in place with a reliable piston lock that can be released quickly with a sliding button. An additional safety lock offers extra security when the blade is closed. For easy reference, the lock switch shows red when the knife is ready to open.Cryogenic Heat Treatment for Sharp, Dependable BladesOf course the workhorse of any knife is the cutting surface, and FSA-98 offers a full, 3.5-inch, half-serrated blade with an elegant satin finish.SOG's proprietary Cryogenic Heat Treatment process ensures that this blade will stay sharp over the long haul. This intensive process takes more than 48 hours and involves slowly bringing the blade's temperature down to less than -300 degrees Fahrenheit, then bringing it slowly back to room temperature. The stress created through this process relieves the material on an atomic level and increases overall strength and edge retention.Elegant, Ergonomic Design for Ease of UseEven if your blade is sharp, it's hard to make the cuts you want if a knife doesn't sit comfortably in your hand. That's why the handle on this knife features a unique, ergonomic contour. Crafted from tough, glass-reinforced Zytel, the handle helps ensure that your knife is both durable and well-balanced. And it is lightly textured to prevent slippage.At just 3.1 ounces, this folding knife is lightweight and easy to carry. A reversible, bayonet-mounted clip extends from the back of the handle, allowing the knife to sit low in your pocket for the most discreet carry possible.This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against defects in workmanship and materials.About SOG: Strong, Innovative, Specialty ToolsSOG originally stood for Studies and Observation Group, an elite joint services military group designed to handle covert operations during the Vietnam War.

This griddle is essential for big breakfasts, tortillas, quesadillas, roasted vegetables and grilled sandwiches. Cast iron loves a campfire, a stovetop, or an oven, and can slow-cook foods without scorching. It retains heat well so you can sear meat at higher temperatures and will keep your delicious meals warm for a long time. Whether used in a kitchen or camp, theses virtually indestructible cookware should last for generations. Made of cast iron, this griddle evenly distributes heat from the bottom through the sidewalls. Sporting a stylish black color, the cast iron cookware looks good in most kitchens and it doubles up as an excellent source of nutritional iron. This pre-seasoned griddle is ready-to-use right out of the box. While the cookware comes pre-seasoned to prevent food from sticking, it works best when sprayed or lightly coated with vegetable oil before use. The Lodge seasoning procedure is a multiple-step process in which the seasoning oil is applied via an electrostatic spray system that coats the cookware, then it&#x2019;s baked in commercial ovens at very high temperatures. This allows the oil to penetrate deeply into the pores of the iron. This seasoning process achieves a seasoned finish that would take many months of home use to achieve. Sometimes during this process, the seasoning oil can collect and create a bubble or slight drip at the bottom of the pan as it&#x2019;s hanging through the production process. And that in turn can turn brown as it&#x2019;s processed through the seasoning ovens. &#xA0;This brown spot is not rust but in fact, carbonized seasoning and will darken with use. &#xA0;The factory seasoning process makes Lodge cast iron products ready to use right out of the box, and the product over time &#x201C;Just keeps getting better&#x201D;. After cooking, clean with a stiff nylon brush and hot water. Using soap is not recommended, and harsh detergents should never be used. Towel dry immediately and apply a light coating of oil to utensil while it is still warm. Cast Iron, like your grandmother used, still ranks as one of the best cooking utensils ever made. It gives you a nearly non-stick surface, without the possible harmful fumes generated by preheating chemically treated nonstick cookware. The American-based company, Lodge, has been fine-tuning its construction of rugged, cast-iron cookware for more than a century. Measures 10.5-inches diameter and .5-inches deep",Lodge

It is defined by the width in feet or meters of the area visible at 1000 yards or meters. A wide angle binocular features a wide field of view and is better for following action.

Featuring full-sized, 1-inch Advanced Monotube Construction, 50-yard parallax setting, and rings to fit standard .22 bases, this scope lives up to Tasco's well-earned reputation for quality, value, and reliability. Magenta multi-layered lens coatings and fully coated optics provide bright, clear images, and 100% waterproof and fogproof construction assure your hunt will never be rained out.This scope has a matte finish, with a bright, clear image and a wide range of magnification. It features a 30/30 reticle; rings included.3-9x variable magnification32mm objective lensMatte finishMagenta coating (reduced reflection, fully coated optics throughout)Tech TalkWhat the Numbers Mean:The numbers for each scope tell you the scope&Otilde;s power or magnification rating, whether the magnification can be increased or decreased with a zoom dial, and the diameter of the objective lens. So, a 3-9x40mm is a scope with a variable zoom magnification from 3x to 9x with a 40 millimeter objective lens.How Much Magnification:Because high-powered riflescopes have a smaller field-of-view than a lower powered scope, choose your magnification with the distance you will be shooting in mind. Use low power for close shots in brush or deep woods and high power when hunting distant game in the mountains, open fields and prairie.Fixed vs. Zoom Magnification:Variable power scopes, or zooms, offer the benefits of high, medium and low powers, all in one scope. Zooms are particularly advantageous in changing light, weather, environmental conditions or geographic locations and when you're hunting different types of game. In short, variables enable the hunter to use the scope under various circumstances--from close-in brush hunting to open range hunting. Fixed or low power scopes are recommended for hunting dangerous game, especially at close range or in dense foliage where a wide field of view is required and where a mistake in distance estimation could have dire consequences.",Tasco

DotTech TalkMagnification (Power): Riflescopes are often referred to by two numbers separated by an ""x"". For example: 4x40. The first number is the power or magnification of the scope. With a ""4x"", the object being viewed appears to be four times closer than when seen with the unaided eye.Objective Lens Size: The second number in the formula (4x40) is the diameter of the objective or front lens. The larger the objective lens, the more light that enters the scope, and the brighter the image.Field of View (F.O.V.): The side-to-side measurement of the circular viewing field or subject area. It is defined by the width in feet or meters of the area visible at 1000 yards or meters. A wide angle binocular features a wide field of view and is better for following action. Generally, the higher the magnification, the narrower the field of view.Reticle: A reticle is the crosshair or pattern placed in the eyepiece of the scope which establishes the gun's position on the target.",Bushnell

He noticed a lot of luxury cars lacking quality, leather covers, and established Classic Accessories to do something about it. In 1984, Jacob Engelstein took his leather steering wheel covers to market, having worked with his wife Barb out of their basement in Seattle&#x2019;s Roosevelt neighborhood. With the help of two business partners and a few sales reps, Classic Accessories&#x2019; covers started appearing in auto parts and accessories stores across the country.Jacob and his growing team gradually expanded their business and moved out of the basement. Today, with over 500 products in eight categories, Classic Accessories protects a variety of consumer products, and helps consumers pursue their outdoor adventures.

The first were bags and racks designed for touring. From there, Blackburn grew.

Air inside the hubs contracts and a vacuum is created. Water and dirt are sucked into the hubs through the inner seals and corrosion sets in immediately. Bearing failure can be expected within two seasons in fresh water - one season in salt water. When properly installed and maintained, bearing buddy prevents wheel bearing failure and eliminates bearing repacking. Boat trailer wheels can be completely submerged. Bearing buddy also prevents bearing failure on motorcycle, utility, snowmobile, camping, and other trailers by eliminating moisture build-up in hubs and providing proper lubrication. A wheel hub does not have bearing protection unless a slight positive pressure is maintained inside the hub. If pressure is not maintained, water will enter and corrode bearings. Bearing buddy creates this pressure, which is limited to 3 psi. features The original product proven in 25 years of service keeps water and dirt out of hubs makes boat trailer wheels safely submersible, ends the mess of repacking bearings.
