Bilingual English/Polish Language.""Czes&#322;aw Czapli&#324;ski's album discloses to us treasures that have long been kept hidden. Accumulated over years, these collections have until now gladdened the eyes of the collectors and their close circles only. Thanks to the author's passion and persistent efforts we can feel almost like discoverers of terra incognita. At the same time we should be aware that we are experiencing a unique initiation by being ushered into the collectors' intimate worlds. Frequently tangled and knotty, the fortunes of people and institutions loom in the background of the collections. This publication has one more effect that cannot be overestimated: it changes the stereotypical image of a Pole in America, who no longer dreams of a better life on the other side of the Atlantic, but actually and beautifully lives one.""~ Ferdynand B. Ruszczyc""Czes&#322;aw Czapli&#324;ski traced painstakingly Polish art collections across the U.S.A.

Nothing covers more ground with less effort, the most durable and convenient lawn sprinklers on the market. Self-propels across the lawn, following the pattern you lay out with the hose. The Nelson travelers are equipped with 3 speed settings and are designed to automatically shut off at any given point along your hose track. Ideal for medium to large established lawns with open areas. Nelson was the first in the industry to introduce the traveling sprinkler and it remains a core item today.While an automatic sprinkling system certainly ensures greener grass and nurtured flowerbeds during the sweltering days of summer, not every household comes equipped with such a system and they can be downright expensive to install. Historically, the alternative to the built-in sprinkler system has involved setting up a hose and sprinkler and then manually relocating the water source to several strategic locations every thirty minutes for several hours. Despite all the detail and time this manual system receives, the sprinkler never quite makes contact with certain patches. Likewise, swamping also occurs at times because homeowners generally have more important things to worry about than whether it is time to switch the sprinkler. Luckily, the folks at LR Nelson are employed to worry about finding comprehensive watering methods for busy homeowners who don't have the means, time, or desire to dig up the yard to install and intricate system of sprinkler pipes. Responsible for a bevy of creative lawn care solutions, the Peoria, Illinois outfit introduce this ingenious Raintrain traveling sprinkler.With a rustproof cast iron construction, the sprinkler waters up to 13, 500 square feet, though covering a lesser area of 11,9000 square feet ensures more effective performance. The sprinkler arms adjust for varied spray patterns and arcs, throwing water from 15 to 56 feet. The sprinkler waters as it travels along a hose on a preset route, much like an electric model train, except with a hose as the rails. To water, the homeowner lays out the hose as desired, taking care to avoid dramatic corners or turnabouts that may result in hose kinks or a derailed sprinkler. A front wheel runs on the hose with the two traction-ready rear wheels bestride. The hose connects to the posterior of the sprinkler. For the best results, LR Nelson recommends a 5/8-inch hose, though a 1/2-inch hose may suffice, up to 200 feet in length. For sprinkling termination, the user places a shut-off ramp on the hose to lift the sprinkler off its ""rails,"" while simultaneous stopping operation. The shut-off ramp should be installed with at least five feet of hose between it and the spigot. The traveling sprinkler operates at two motor speeds, high and low. On high power, the sprinkler travels approximately 37 feet per hour, with a 1/4-inch water application. On low power, the sprinkler moves at a 21 feet per hour rate with a 1/2-inch water application. The simple installation requires no tools. The sprinkler weighs 18.1 pounds upon shipping.--Jessica Reuling",Nelson

Even at his most explorative, he never seems rash or unfocused; on the contrary, he always seems to know exactly what he's doing with each cascading flurry. The fierce,Coltrane-like calisthenics he performs on ""Touch Your Toes"" soon give way to the sumptuously slow-grinding ""Blacken' Blue,"" in which he savors each note as if he were sucking on a rib tip. On the surface, this often raucous record has little in common with an album of Ellington ballads. But there are telling similarities, most notably the confidence and certainty with which Smith plays and the supreme importance that he places on his full-bodied tone.

For true hummingbird lovers, it elicits a singular kind of glee. Hummingbirds can consume two-thirds of their body weight in one day, and, for those who love to watch the strange motion of these special creatures, that fact is an incentive to attract and nurture them with a bountiful supply of nectar.  The 16-ounce container measures more than a foot high and requires assembly of four double perches with self-tapping screws (you'll need a screwdriver) and eight snap-in feeding flowers. It's imperative that the reservoir bottom is securely twisted and locked to avoid a 3-quart red nectar spill. Some drip is unavoidable if nectar falls below 2 inches from the bottom in direct sunlight (read directions carefully). Perky Pet recommends that you clean and change the nectar at least weekly, that you never add fresh nectar to old nectar, and, if possible, that you avoid mold and algae by placing the feeder in direct sunlight and away from moisture.

Users fill the roller&#x92;s drum with up to 400 pounds of water or sand and hook it up behind a tractor. The tractor tows the roller over lawns and fields, flattening uneven grass or leveling new soil in 36-inch wide swathes. Rolling may also help plant new seeds for uniform growth and eliminate mole holes.The roller&#x92;s drum is crafted in a sturdy polyethylene, which resists dents, rust, and weather damage. Powder-baked paint provides further protection. Agri-Fab welded the seams on the drum with rounded edges to prevent any uneven grooves while also providing a leak-proof seal. A brass plug closes the 1-inch filling hole. To remove debris, the roller includes a poly scraper bar. A center baffler provides additional stability to ensure the polyethylene drum does not flex and loose its shape. A hitch pin accompanies the roller to accommodate a trouble-free hook up. The roller is shipped without fill for easy transportation. Users who fill the roller drum with water should drain the drum before winter to ensure the water does not freeze and crack the polyethylene. For user who prefer to fill with sand, Agri-Fab recommends filling the drum only halfway full. To tow the filled roller, a vehicle with a 12 HP engine or greater is required. Towing on hills is highly unadvisable. The roller was manufactured in the USA. A limited one-year warranty may be available for this item. The roller drum spans 36 inches wide with an 18-inch diameter.",Agri-Fab

Snap traps are thought of as the more humane lethal rat trap, killing rats quickly. Snap traps also don&#x92;t pose the health risks affiliated with rat poisons.The base of this snap trap is made from Forest Stewardship Council-sourced wood harvested from environmentally-monitored forests. The wood has been kiln dried and will not warp. The trap&#x92;s metal pedal has four releases for greater success in catching rats. The trap has a copper-steel wire bow. Two springs are oil-tempered for efficiency.For best results, bait the trap with a sticky substance. Rats are fond of peanut butter, fruit, meat, and cereal. Using several traps and placing them three feet apart in the rats&#x92; foot path increases the chances of success. After catching a rat, Victor advises users to throw out the trap.

From the Manufacturer: So easy to use you can forget the instructions, the Rain Bird&#xAE; SST-1200o's intuitive zone-by-zone scheduling allows you to set different watering times for each area of the yard, providing greener results with less water. By turning the dial to the appropriate zone, you can easily set your system to water full sun areas more and shaded areas less, or water slopes and clay soils in short intervals to allow water to soak in--an important step in avoiding runoff. You can also vary the timing and frequency of pop-up sprays vs. rotor zones and customize the drip zones to water trees, flowerbeds and landscapes. The SST-1200o offers one-touch seasonal adjustments, allowing you to increase watering in hot, dry months and reduce it in rainy periods. The timer is also compatible with an optional rain sensor, which automatically shuts off the timer when it's raining. And maintenance is easy thanks to the built-in troubleshooting feature. If the timer detects a short, it suspends watering to that zone and displays a warning message. The timer even protects against surges from nearby lightning strikes and power surges. If power is interrupted, the timer stores the settings indefinitely without the need for a backup battery. To install the SST-1200o, simply strip the wires and push them into the color-coded terminals--no screwdriver necessary. The terminals make it easy to connect zone wires, master valves, pump start relays, or a rain sensor.",Rain Bird

This nifty device plugs into a standard electrical wall outlet; is silent as, well, a mouse; looks like an air freshener; and really works. Varmints of all sorts--from rats to squirrels to fleas--head for the hills when the PestContro is activated. How does it work? PestContro Deluxe has a unique system that combines electromagnetic and ultrasonic technology. In layman's terms, it transmits a harsh, high-pitched sound through the air into the coverage area, including walls, ceilings, and floors. The sound is inaudible to humans, but if you want to hear what your cockroach hears, just press the test button on top of the device. Basically, the noise drives pests nuts and they skedaddle. The handy instruction booklet gives you lots of tips on setting the right frequency to snag the right pest. The best thing about this device is that it uses no chemicals, so it's safe around children and pets.--C. Whitney-Ward",Lentek

Constructed with an all-welded frame, the unit features a raised rim  for extra stability and sturdy U-shaped legs. Switching between cooking  methods is simple and straightforward.

Replace the lava rocks with  charcoal, and voila, you now have a charcoal grill. In its charcoal  grill configuration, the All-in-One can be removed from its standing  legs for camping, tailgate parties, or picnics. As a smoker, powered by  charcoal or by gas, the cooker uses two racks to hold up to 50 pounds  of food and a water/marinade pan to generate steam.An integral part of the All-in-One's versatility, the dome lid fits  every configuration and includes a simple heat indicator to cut down on  guesswork.

They dig in the sand at the beach, or in the flower boxes at home, hoping to find a pirate's booty, an Egyptian King's tomb, or a lost toy. As children grow, the meaning of treasure evolves from mythical wooden chests stuffed with gold into more commonplace articles, but the hunt maintains that sense of adventure. For those who covet treasures of the metal variety, Bounty Hunter offers their Lone Star metal detector. Those individuals who prize Mother Earth also benefit from the detector, redirecting littered cans to the recycling bin.The detector scans using a waterproof 8-inch coil on an ergonomic S-rod. Moving the coil levelly over the ground or water, the unit detects small items up to 8 inches below and larger items up to 3 feet under. Three different operation modes further assist the bounty hunter. For indiscriminate prospecting, press the ""all metal"" button on the detector's touch pad, while selecting ""auto notch"" eliminates most pull-tabs and trash items from detection. The ""discriminate notch"" method eradicates iron and trash and allows the user to manually adjust the DISC/NOTCH knob to rule out other metals. The detector deciphers a target's metal composition both visually on the LCD screen, and audibly with a tone through the built-in speakers. A low tone indicates nails, bottle caps, gold or nickel while a medium tone suggests pull-tabs, zinc, and post-1982 pennies. High tones denote copper, silver, brass, and pre-1982 pennies. A headphone jack is installed. Headphones must be purchased separately, as must the two 9-volt alkaline batteries that power the detector. This item is covered under a five-year warranty. The USA-made detector measures 28.7 by 10.5 by 6.7 inches upon shipping and weighs 4.6 pounds.--Jessica Reuling",Bounty Hunter

Also useful for indoor cooking, the Pig Tail turns any food from chicken breasts and hot sandwiches to tortillas and bacon. The Pig Tail is essentially a curved hook at the end of a shaft that pierces the edge of any food and turns it with a flip of the wrist. The Pig Tail&#x92;s hook and shaft are made of surgical-grade stainless-steel for strength and durability and the hook will not leave marks in your meat or cause meats to bleed. This set ships with two Pig Tails&#x97;a 19-inch tool that&#x92;s great for outdoor cooking and a shorter 12-inch model that works for stovetop grilling or saut&eacute;ing.

For gardens, berry bushes, and grapevines: mount Owl on top of a tall pole and drive pole firmly into the ground (Owl must be positioned vertically for head to move properly).  Move Owl every few days.  For rooftops and ledges:  secure Owl by tying in place or weight heavily.  Owl can be filled with sand or gravel for more stability (use enclosed stopper).  It is important to move the Owl every few days and to place it in a prominent spot to be most effective.  For best results:  Owl must be positioned vertically for head to move properly.  Place Owl before fruit ripens and feeding habits develop.  Place Owl in a prominent place so birds can see it.  For added effectiveness, move Owl around garden every few days.

Every tree order includes specific growing instructions.Delivery and Packaging: What to expect when you receive your bonsaiTo ensure only well-established, healthy trees are shipped, Brussel's Bonsai imports its trees from nurseries in China where growers spend years training and shaping tree branches. Some bonsai defoliate (drop leaves) when their environment changes. If upon the tree's arrival some leaves have dropped or turned slightly brown that does not mean the bonsai is unhealthy. Defoliation is the natural result of being in the low-light environment of a shipping box. Whenever possible, Brussel&#146;s Bonsai avoids using Styrofoam-popcorn packaging. In some cases, Styrofoam popcorn must be used to safely pack unusually shaped bonsai. Organic popcorn packaging made from corn starch reacts with moisture from the trees and can dissolve. When you receive your tree, place the box in a shaded area to unpack. Inspect tree for damage to branches or leaves. Water soil if dry. Place each bonsai in protected shade for at least one week before moving to a sunny location.What is a Bonsai?Literally, the Japanese word ""bonsai"" means ""tray tree"" or ""plant grown in a pot."" The term refers to the artistic techniques used to capture the natural beauty of trees, rather than a specific variety of tree. A full-grown tree and a bonsai can be grown from the same seed --the bonsai has simply been dwarfed and shaped through years of training. To develop authentic bonsai, Brussels grows specimens under carefully controlled conditions, meticulously training each tree with wire and pruning over a period of years. The value of a particular bonsai typically depends on size, age, and training. Generally, more expensive trees are larger, older, and have had more detailed, elaborate training. These qualities combined create the illusion of a large tree in a natural setting.Tropical/Indoor Bonsai CareClimateSuited to bright, humid, equatorial climates, tropical bonsai prefer common room temperatures, between 65 and 75 degrees F, 3 to 4 hours of direct sunlight, and humidity levels of about 75%. If your home tends to be dry, a cool mist humidifier or ceramic bonsai humidity tray can help mimic the moist, tropical climate ideal for growing indoor bonsai.PlacementIndoor bonsai are tropical plants adaptable to indoor conditions. Select a spot with good air circulation, but avoid cold drafts, drying heat vents, and appliances with heat exhausts. They prefer sunny areas near windows facing southeast or west. Choose a location that receives morning sun and afternoon shade. Though they grow well indoors year-round, tropical bonsai flourish outdoors on a patio or deck that receives indirect sunlight. They can withstand outdoor summer temperatures up to 100 degrees F, as well as dryer, desert climates as long as they are watered adequately. Bring bonsai indoors when night temperatures fall below 55 degrees F. Do not allow tropical bonsai to freeze.In Japan, bonsai are traditionally displayed against a solid black, white, wood, or bamboo background, or on a stand or pot larger than the tree. Stark contrasts enhance a bonsai&#146;s simple beauty.WateringIn fall, winter and spring, water tropical bonsai thoroughly every two or three days. In hot summer months, water daily--especially in dry, hot climates. Use a can or hose attachment that casts a soft, rain-like spray that won&#146;t disturb the soil in the pot. Bonsai can never be allowed to dry out.Soil and fertilizerBonsai trees spend years in the same soil and eventually deplete the available nutrients. Providing supplemental nutrition is essential for a healthy tree. Most water soluble and time-released fertilizers work well when used as directed.Run wire through drainTrim rootballWork soil into rootsRepottingBonsai need to be repotted every 3 to 5 years. After receiving your tree, wait at least one growing season before repotting. Using proper bonsai soil is critical. Brussel&#146;s bonsai soil consists of a mixture of high-fired clay particles and finely ground pine bark. The soil-free mix does not compact, allows water to drain easily, plus helps prevent the root rot that often occurs with ordinary potting soil.It is important to pot your bonsai correctly. Prepare your container for potting by putting screen over the drain holes Run wire through the drain screen--you will need this to secure the tree in the container. Trim the rootball so it will fit in the bonsai pot.  Keep in mind, cutting larger roots is better than cutting small feeder roots. Continue trimming the root ball until it will fit into the bonsai container. Be sure to place a good layer of bonsai soil on the bottom of the bonsai container.Place the tree in the pot. Use the wire to secure the tree in the bonsai container. Twist and pull the wire with pliers to tighten. Add bonsai soil around the root ball. Use a chopstick to work the bonsai soil into the root system. Your bonsai should now be secure in its new container.TrainingAll bonsai require some degree of seasonal pruning. Regular pruning produces smaller branches and maintains the tree&#146;s miniature size. A simple pair of pointed-nose scissors does the job. Wiring may also be used to hold branches in a desired position or location. If you&#146;re happy with the branch placement as is, there is no real need to wire. For detailed instruction in the art of bonsai cultivation, Brussel&#146;s Bonsai recommends purchasing a book on basic training techniques.If you choose to wire your bonsai, make sure to use heavier gauge wire for larger branches on the bottom of the tree, and lighter gauge for smaller branches. Begin by sticking the end of the wire into the soil next to the trunk of the tree. Wrap the wire around the trunk until you come to the first branch. Continue curling the wire around the branch. Once you have come to the end of a branch, cut and remove the excess wire. The wire now allows you to bend the branch into the desired shape and location.LifespanMost bonsai trees can live up to 100 years or more depending, of course, on the quality of care they receive.The Story of Brussel's Bonsai NurseryWhen Brussel Martin was five years old, he was instantly captivated by several bonsai his father brought back from a California business trip. As a teenager, he began to seriously study the art of bonsai. What started as an artistic endeavor in his parents' backyard quickly grew into a business. In the 1970s, he began selling bonsai through the mail and traveling to shows across the country. By the early '80s, he was making annual buying trips to Asia.As the business has grown, so has his desire to introduce bonsai to more and more Americans.

In dry climate areas, you can use the humidity tray to help mimic the ideal conditions.  The ideal outdoor growing areas are places where the temperatures stay above 40&deg;F. Although gardenias are outdoor plants, if your climate is too cold (below 45&deg;F for 6 months or longer), they can be grown indoors &ndash; but you will need to water them less frequently. If you do need to place it indoors they prefer sunny areas near windows facing southeast or west. Choose a location that receives morning sun and afternoon shade. Bring your gardenia bonsai when night temperatures fall below 40 degrees F. Do not allow any bonsai to freeze. To ensure flowering, gardenias (like all flowering plants) must go through a dormancy period. This is usually a period of 3 to 4 months at 35&deg;F to 40&deg;F. Without this, your gardenia will not flower. If you have to grow your gardenia indoors, you can mimic this by placing your gardenia into a cold room, basement, or garage&hellip;as long as there is light and you keep it watered as normal.In Japan, bonsai are traditionally displayed against a solid black, white, wood, or bamboo background, or on a stand or pot larger than the tree.

Begin by sticking the end of the wire into the soil next to the trunk of the tree. Wrap the wire around the trunk until you come to the first branch. Continue curling the wire around the branch. Once you have come to the end of a branch, cut and remove the excess wire. The wire now allows you to bend the branch into the desired shape and location.LifespanMost bonsai trees can live up to 100 years or more depending, of course, on the quality of care they receive.The Story of Brussel's Bonsai NurseryWhen Brussel Martin was five years old, he was instantly captivated by several bonsai his father brought back from a California business trip.

In autumn their leaves turn vibrant shades of red. This Chinese elm is 10 years old, 10 to 14 inches tall, and comes in a 10-inch pot. Every tree order includes specific growing instructions.Delivery and Packaging: What to expect when you receive your bonsaiTo ensure only well-established, healthy trees are shipped, Brussel's Bonsai imports its trees from nurseries in China where growers spend years training and shaping tree branches. Some bonsai defoliate (drop leaves) when their environment changes. If upon the tree's arrival some leaves have dropped or turned slightly brown that does not mean the bonsai is unhealthy. Defoliation is the natural result of being in the low-light environment of a shipping box. Whenever possible, Brussel&#x92;s Bonsai avoids using Styrofoam-popcorn packaging. In some cases, Styrofoam popcorn must be used to safely pack unusually shaped bonsai.  Organic popcorn packaging made from corn starch reacts with moisture from the trees and can dissolve. When you receive your tree, place the box in a shaded area to unpack. Inspect tree for damage to branches or leaves. Water soil if dry. Place each bonsai in protected shade for at least one week before moving to a sunny location.What is a Bonsai?Literally, the Japanese word ""bonsai"" means ""tray tree"" or ""plant grown in a pot.""  The term refers to the artistic techniques used to capture the natural beauty of trees, rather than a specific variety of tree. A full-grown tree and a bonsai can be grown from the same seed--the bonsai has simply been dwarfed and shaped through years of training. To develop authentic bonsai, Brussels grows specimens under carefully controlled conditions, meticulously training each tree with wire and pruning over a period of years. The value of a particular bonsai typically depends on size, age, and training. Generally, more expensive trees are larger, older, and have had more detailed, elaborate training. These qualities combined create the illusion of a large tree in a natural setting.Deciduous/Outdoor Bonsai CareClimateOutdoor bonsai are deciduous trees that require the same climate changes in spring, summer, fall, and winter as full-sized trees of the same species. As a rule, deciduous bonsai do well in regions with humidity levels of 50% to 75% and yearly temperature ranges of 20 to 100 degree F. During winter, deciduous bonsai must remain outdoors. This period of dormancy is essential--without it, the tree may become unhealthy and susceptible to disease.  Protect or ""heel-in"" your bonsai by covering the pot and soil with pine needles or mulch. Place the tree against a wall to shield it from extreme winds. Outdoor bonsai are more vulnerable to extreme cold than full-size trees and should be moved to a garage, shed, cold frame, or basement when temperatures fall below 20 degrees F.PlacementDeciduous bonsai need to be kept outdoors year-round. Natural sunlight and rainwater are both important elements in an ideal growing environment. Typically, they require six or more hours of direct sunlight a day and do well in locations that get shade from late afternoon sun. Outdoor bonsai may be displayed indoors once a month, for short periods of time (2-3 days). In Japan, bonsai are traditionally displayed against a solid black, white, wood, or bamboo background, or on a stand or pot larger than the tree. Stark contrasts enhance the bonsai&#x92;s simple beauty.WateringGenerally speaking, water when the top of the soil is dry. Use a can or hose attachment that casts a soft, rain-like spray that won&#x92;t disturb the soil in the pot. Do not allow bonsai to dry out. Water daily during hot summer months.  In winter, though trees need less water, it&#x92;s a good idea to water well before a hard freeze (frozen water acts as insulation).Soil and fertilizerBonsai trees spend years in the same soil and eventually deplete the available nutrients. Providing supplemental nutrition is essential for a healthy tree. Most water soluble and time-released fertilizers work well when used as directed.Run wire through drainTrim rootballWork soil into rootsRepottingBonsai need to be repotted every 3 to 5 years.  After receiving your tree, wait at least one growing season before repotting. Using proper bonsai soil is critical.  Brussel&#x92;s bonsai soil consists of a mixture of high-fired clay particles and finely ground pine bark.  The soil-free mix does not compact, allows water to drain easily, and helps prevent the root rot that often occurs with ordinary potting soil.It is important to pot your bonsai correctly. Prepare your container for potting by putting screen over the drain holes. Run wire through the drain screen--you will need this to secure the tree in the container. Trim the rootball so it will fit in the bonsai pot.  Keep in mind, cutting larger roots is better than cutting small feeder roots. Continue trimming the root ball until it will fit into the bonsai container. Be sure to place a good layer of bonsai soil on the bottom of the bonsai container.Place the tree in the pot. Use the wire to secure the tree in the bonsai container. Twist and pull the wire with pliers to tighten. Add bonsai soil around the root ball. Use a chopstick to work the bonsai soil into the root system. Your bonsai should now be secure in its new container.TrainingAll bonsai require some degree of seasonal pruning.  Regular pruning produces smaller branches. A simple pair of pointed-nose scissors does the job.  Wiring may also be used to hold them in a desired position or location. If you&#x92;re happy with the branch placement as is, there is no real need to wire.  For detailed instruction in the art of pruning bonsai, Brussel&#x92;s Bonsai recommends purchasing a book on basic training techniques.If you choose to wire your bonsai, make sure to use heavier gauge wire for larger branches on the bottom of the tree, and lighter gauge for smaller branches. Begin by sticking the end of the wire into the soil next to the trunk of the tree. Wrap the wire around the trunk until you come to the first branch. Continue curling the wire around the branch.

The user can monitor digging depth with the engraved gauge on the trowel surface. The plastic handle provides ergonomic gripping. When idle, the trowel tucks into a side pocket of the treasure pouch for neat storage. The pouch features durable nylon construction with two outer pockets for stowing the trowel and a water bottle. There also are two interior pockets for bounty or for accumulated litter. The user wears the pouch around the waist and can adjust the 2-inch wide web belt through the sturdy buckle for comfort.

Blumat Plant Savers ensure a constant supply of water. They automatically supply just the right amount - never too much or not enough. Your plants will love it. They won't experience the drying out that stunts growth or the over-watering that squeezes the air out of the soil and keeps them from ""breathing"" properly. As the soil dries, the ceramic cone delivers water gradually into the surrounding earth - thereby creating a vacuum within the cone which draws water from the nearby container of water. Once the soil is moistened the Blumat Junior will cease flowing water. It waters your plants only as needed. You can even add fertilizer to the water supply. This slow, continual feeding encourages prolific growth. Blumat Juniors will only draw water up 12 inches (30cm). If the surface of the water in your container is lower than this, the flow of water will be restricted and the plants gradually dry out. Each Blumat Jr. has a limit on how fast it can deliver water. Several cones may be necessary for larger plants in order to meet the higher water needs. In this case, a larger reservoir of water must also be available. Detailed Instructions: 1. Fill a bowl with water. Remove the top of the Blumat Jr. Put both the top and ceramic cone into the bowl to soak for at least 15 minutes. 2. Holding the cone and cap underwater, knock out the air bubbles in each piece and press the top on tightly. 3. Push the ceramic cone completely into the soil. Extra large plants should be provided with two or three cones. 4. Put the hose right to the bottom of a full container of water. Add a little liquid fertilizer if necessary. 5. The level of water in the container should be level with or below the green cap. Raising or lowering the water container increases or reduces the flow rate.",Blumat

Use Clearex to correct the most common cause of crop failture - The buildup of nutrient salt deposits in soils or soilless grow media. High salt concentrations in the soil solution cause a shrinkage of plant cell protoplasm away from the cell wall as a result of osmosis. This condition , know as plasmolysis, can eventually lead to irreversible wilting. Clearex is a scientifically formulated isotonic drench solution, which binds with excess nutrient salts and safely leaches them from the soil. Leaching with tap or deionized water can lead to hyptonic conditions which cause cell lysis with outflow of essential electrolytes and nutrients; this causes tissue damage leading to serious pathogenic disorders such as bacterial and fungal infections. Clearex is isotonic to create a safe osmotic environment, which allows plant cells to maintain an optimal turgor pressure during treatment.Clearex can also be used at the end of a crop's growth cycle to trigger the last reproductive stage of the plant, forcing it to process and assimilate endogenous nutrients.Clearex contains specific electrolytes and select mono and disaccharides which provide energy for the biosynthesis of important plant metabolites and macromolecules.

The adjustable hopper provides up to 12 cubic feet for waste and collapses flat for compact storage. A windscreen prevents wind gusts from blowing swept dirt and leaves back onto the ground. An upright handle on the sweeper allows users to dump contents from the tractor seat. The sweeper travels diverse terrains on two 11-by-2-1/2- semi-pneumatic tires. A hitch pin is included for quick tractor hook-up. The lawn sweeper only activates brushes while in forward movement and will not sweep while reversing.

MN-51/AFA (Animal Feed Additive) is a CODEX Food-Grade natural diatomaceous earth (D.E.) product composed of microscopic diatoms that were deposited in ancient lake beds. These diatoms are made of amorphous silica in complex lacy shapes, which promotes a high absorption capacity and makes AFA an ideal product for anti-caking applications in grain and animal feed storage. AFA is non-toxic and safe for the environment. The benefits of D.E. as a natural insecticide for grain storage, garden, and animal use are well-established in practice. Natural D.E. powders have been used by farmers for centuries. With the increased popularity of organic and sustainable farming methods, more and more livestock and pet owners are re-discovering the natural benefits of D.E. as an animal feed additive. We cannot make claims about internal therapeutic benefits because of the prohibitive expense of the clinical studies that would be required by the government. However, many livestock and pet owners that have used AFA over the long term tell us they have experienced: When insects come in contact with diatomaceous earth, the D.E. absorbs their protective wax coating and their shells are damaged by the glassy diatoms. This combination causes them to die by dehydration. There is no survival and no built-up immunity as there is with chemical insecticides. D.E. also does not break down as chemicals do, and the more that it is used, the more insects feel unwelcome in the area.",Celatom

Test your soil with accuracy and ease to determine if you need to adjust soil acidity. The pH scale ranging from 0 to 14 is used to indicate acidity and alkalinity. A pH of 7.0 is neutral, values below 7.0 are acid, and those above are alkaline. The lower the pH the more acid is the soil. The higher the pH, the more alkaline. The pH values of some common items are: pure water, 7.0: lemon juice, 2.2 to 2.4; orange juice, 3.4 to 4.0; fresh milk, 6.3 to 6.6; mild soap solution, 8.5 to 10.0; most Ontario soils, 4.5 to 8.0. Soil pH is important chiefly because of the many effects it has on biological and chemical activity of the soil, which effects the metabolism of your plants.

Why break your back if you don&rsquo;t have to? Allsop has   a great way to save your back and still get the job done. The WheelEasyLE is   the next step in the evolution of the wheel barrow. But to be technical, it&rsquo;s   unfair to think of it as a wheel barrow. The WheelEasyLE is a compact and   economical collapsible yard cart. It&rsquo;s the ideal product for yard work   ranging from collecting weeds to spreading bark, moving gravel or rocks or   even pruning. Seriously, this tool will make the work easier. When you drop   the handles to the ground, you get ground, level loading. You don&rsquo;t need to   lift anything to get it into the WheelEasyLE, just rake, shovel or slide. The   only lifting you do is lifting the handles from the ground. And according to   the laws of physics, you&rsquo;re only lifting a portion of the load. Use the   WheelEasyLE to make it easier to replant a shrub, move a boulder, put out   some bark or rake some leaves. Use a wheel barrow to mix concrete.

Gro-Tec is UV resistant, waterproof and features rip stop protection. The Gro-Tec material is more beneficial for plant growth than clear glass or plastic because it diffuses or scatters light. Diffused light can benefit plants, both by reducing excess light on upper leaves and by increasing the amount of light reflected onto lower leaves. Too much direct sunlight on the upper leaves can overheat the plant and thus reduce photosynthesis.

Adjustable perches offer two different perch heights to accommodate all nine species of orioles. A patented bee guard keeps pests out and secures food. A convenient hanging hole permits owners to hang the feeder by a special stand or on tree branches.Opus even includes an oriole identification chart to inform bird enthusiasts. To attract orioles to the feeder, place it in a sheltered southeast location in the yard or garden. Orioles also enjoy dining on fresh oranges and grape or apple jelly. Keep the feeder stocked year-round to nourish any birds that linger through a cold winter, and help tired birds rebuild strength after the long flight north in spring. To deter pesky squirrels, hang the oriole feeder from tree branches as far from the trunk as possible and at least four feet above the ground.

The inspiration for Orange Guard came from McPartland&#xFFFD;s desire to find an alternative to these insecticides which have the potential of long-term health and environmental dangers. In 1984, McPartland read an article in Science News, where someone had taken citrus hand cleaner and poured it down a fire ant hill. Every ant was killed. ""If you ever look at oranges, you'll notice that the peels are never bitten into by anything,"" says McPartland. ""Orange peel is a natural repellent."" Starting in 1985, McPartland spent the next 14 years in research and development efforts, including extensive testing and certification for safety and effectiveness.  In May 1998, McPartland introduced his first product to consumers. That product was Orange Guard, a water based indoor/outdoor insecticide that may be used around food, humans and pets. Made from d-Limonene (orange peel extract) and inert ingredients, Orange Guard is EPA-registered and now available to consumers.  Works naturally on ants, fire ants, roaches, fleas, silverfish, aphids, spider mites, leaf hoppers, scale insects, and other insect pests.",ORANGE GUARD
