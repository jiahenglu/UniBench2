I really love the concept of this calendar because it has stickers for time spent with Mom &amp; time spent with Dad!! My niece was a bit upset about daddy not living with them anymore so this calendar really helped her feel better. She used the stickers to indicate all the days she gets to see Daddy and it helped her to see that she'll get to spend a lot of time with him. It also is great for any kids because there are times when a child is looking forward to doing something special with Mommy or Daddy and those stickers can be used that way, too! But there are stickers for every occasion, including birthdays, holidays, soccer practice. I think the best part about this calendar is that it can be started any time of the year because it is not dated. The child can use the stickers to indicate that the first month, and it can start in December or June for that matter, but will last a full year. This calendar is education in many ways as it teaches, basic calendar concepts, when certain holidays fall (like Thanksgiving - last Thursday in November) v. Independence Day always being 4th of July. It teaches responsibility by getting the children to be involved in their own schedules, like when practice is or when homework is due, and remembering someone's birthday or anniversary!! By having so many stickers it really keeps the child's interest because each month there are always stickers that can be used up for that month! This is a great gift, I only wish I had more kids to buy it for!! --Tony ""Toy Tripper"" --Tony ""Toy Tripper""I think this calendar is very educational and great in every way. It makes me wish my kids were young again! I bought four calendars, one for each of my young nieces and nephews! --Katie StrzyzewskiI am a grandmother of three.

We developed the inBrief line of camera guides so you can get the answers, and more importantly, the shot you want. Each card is divided into eight color-coded panels. If you have a question about metering or bracketing, simply look at the yellow panel. Questions about custom functions are answered on the green panel. The layout and description for the control panel and view finder can be found on the blue panel. And a color-coded index on the front page immediately points you toward the answer you need. The inBrief guide is laminated for long life and protection from the elements. As importantly, the panels are separated by thin strips of clear lamination, allowing the card to be folded easily and stored in your camera bag. Your inBreif guide won't be a replacement for your manual, but it will remind you of what functions are available, and how you can get them to work for you. Every inBrief includes a line drawing of your camera with the controls for shooting, displaying images, and general operation clearly labeled. It also has a panel that shows you, at a glance, the camera functions available for each mode dial setting, as well as a cross reference to flash sync modes. So quit fumbling with the controls and take control o",Blue Crane Digital

However, this region was the site of even more destructive fighting between Germany and Russia in WWII. Concord&#x2019;s latest book presents in some detail this particular campaign in the 1941-42 timeframe. The attacking German 11.Armee was commanded by Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein, and his goal was to overrun the Crimean Peninsular and take Rostov. The battle was joined on September 24 1941, with the capture of the naval fortress of Sevastapol on the southwestern tip of the peninsular set to be the ultimate prize. The Russian Black Sea Fleet defenders fought bitterly as they reinforced the defenses of Sevastapol and the Crimea. As the fighting wore on, Soviet troops launched counterattacks during the winter of 1941/42. A series of thrusts and counter-thrusts ensued, with Germany only able to clear the Crimea on May 18 1942.",Concord Publications
