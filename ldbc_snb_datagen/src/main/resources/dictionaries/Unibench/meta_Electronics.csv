Increase your productivity, work on other projects, and enjoy more freedom of movement, all without straining your neck trying to support a telephone handset.The HS910 is comfortable and lightweight; after a few minutes, you'll forget you're wearing it. The headset attaches to the cordless handset's 2.5mm headset jack. (We tested the unit on a Uniden EXS 9110, but it fits any 2.5mm-compatible cordless phone.) Once the headset is attached, you cannot use the handset for talking or listening, but you can us it to answer incoming calls and to dial. Having a belt clip on your cordless handset is especially helpful, giving your phone complete unobtrusive portability as you walk around.With the headset, your caller will hear your voice slightly softened compared with how you sound on the handset alone, but otherwise, the headset introduces no additional noise or distortion, and it doesn't reduce the handset's range or battery life. In our tests, even after an hour of continuous use, the headset had not become uncomfortable. For very long calls, you can rotate the headset, as the unit is designed for both left-ear and right-ear listening.The Uniden HS910 headset is a product that really works as advertised.

This device reads and analyzes the information and then generates a noise-cancellation wave that's out of phase with the noise itself. The audio-enhancer pack feeds this wave back into the headset--when the noise wave goes up, a corresponding cancellation wave goes down, causing the two signals to cancel each other out. This eliminates a good deal of unwanted sonic junk, from airplane engine noise to distant freeway traffic seeping into your living room.We evaluated our HP-NC1s as a utility crew used jackhammers on the street outside our listening room. Because you can bypass the Noisebuster technology with a switch, it was easy for us to compare the noise-canceled signal to the standard sound. While Noisebuster didn't entirely eliminate the jackhammer's rat-a-tat-tat, it did significantly reduce the sound so that we could listen to quiet music, such as soft jazz and classical.As for the sound of the headphones themselves, the midrange is clear, but the HP-NC1s are a little sluggish overall, with no deep bass or extended high frequencies. In fairness to the HP-NC1s, noise-canceling headsets often sound restricted in the frequency extremes, as it can be tricky for the noise-canceling devices to differentiate between noise and music. The fit of these headphones is also a little snug for our taste, but you can loosen them a bit by gently bending the headset.We have heard comparably priced, non-noise-canceling headphones that sound better than Maxell's HP-NC1. However, better sound doesn't matter much if you're having a hard time hearing the music in a noisy environment. At this price, these headphones are a bargain.Pros:Noisebuster technology works wellIn-flight dual-jack adapter includedIn-line volume controlCons:Snug fit may be uncomfortableAverage sound quality",Maxell

Don't worry if you're technology-shy, this camera is made so that even the most extreme technophobe can figure it out.To set up the Create and Share Camera Pack, we just plugged our camera into the USB port on the back of our computer, turned it on, loaded the software and the install took care of the rest. The manual was incredibly easy to follow, with large print, nice illustrations, and well-divided sections for quick reference. After the software is installed, you can choose to take a tour of it or explore on your own. We found that the software was intuitive enough to just jump right in.The camera is so small and light, that if you don't permanently mount it in place, it will move around. However, once you secure the camera, it is easy to adjust with both pan and tilt. You can adjust variable lighting settings and a manual focus if the picture isn't quite right. The video looks sharp and surprisingly clear and stays in focus from various distances. Make sure you have at least 28.8 Kbps modem, so that you receive clear, unchoppy video--anything slower won't be worth your time.Aside from videoconferencing, Intel provides a number of other applications for the camera. You can send e-mail postcards, play camera games that let you interact live with the game on the screen, create and edit your own movies, or build your own Web page. One of the perks that sets Intel's package apart from the rest is the Create and Share's additional software that you can send to a friend or family member with whom you want to videoconference. Even if they don't have a camera themselves, it will enable them to see and hear you. For the novice videoconferencer, this package is a great deal, with just enough user-friendly software to make it a worthwhile investment.Pros:Nice, clear videoA great sampling of user-friendly softwareAdjustable cameraEasy to install",Intel

It stores up to 160 minutes of dictation and features PC connectivity and IBM ViaVoice voice-recognition software.To set up the DS-150, you first insert two AAA batteries, then program the date and time to ensure that each message receives the correct date/time stamp when you record a message. Recording messages can be done in one of two modes: standard play (SP) or long play (LP). While LP offers more recording time, SP offers better quality, though both modes produce excellent results at a range of volumes. We also found that the quality was best when the recorder was held about 12 inches from the source.The DS-150 has two folders that can each hold up to 99 messages. When you no longer need messages, you can erase them one at a time or erase an entire folder. It can also connect to your PC via a serial cable and convert spoken words into digital text using the included IBM ViaVoice software. With this feature, you can turn any dictation into an instant memo.You can also make hands-free recordings with the DS-150's VCVA (variable-control voice actuator). With the VCVA turned on, the DS-150 begins recording when the microphone detects your voice and stops recording when you stop talking. This means you won't waste memory by recording silence when you pause during dictation, although you may lose brief moments of sound as the recorder starts and stops.All in all, with its many features, PC connectivity, slim design, and easy-to-read LCD, we found the lightweight Olympus DS-150 digital voice recorder to be quite a nice device.--Megan Dugan",Olympus

But the Ezonics EZCam USB deserves this abbreviation--it is so simple to set up and use that even the most technophobic can operate it.Since the drivers aren't part of Windows 95 or 98, the software needs to be installed first, but this only takes a few seconds. After rebooting, simply plug the camera into a USB port with the connecting cable and Windows 98 picks it up and installs the driver.The EZCam USB ships with a monstrous software bundle, including four Live Express programs--Video Panel, Send Mail, Card Maker, and Album. The package also features three video programs from Ulead--iPhoto Express, iPhoto Impact Album, and iPhoto Express Explorer--as well as Microsoft's Net Meeting for online videoconferencing with anyone else who has the free software and a camera.The Live Express Video Panel works as smoothly as a VCR--press a button to start recording and press another to pause or stop recording. Once you've recorded a snippet of video, you can save it, send it via e-mail (recipients don't need Live Express; the videos will play on any PC), or insert it into an album. The EZCam also lets you take snapshots with one mouse click.That's not to say the EZCam is perfect. Pictures taken with the EZCam's 100,000-pixel image sensor aren't as sharp as photos taken with a digital camera. And we never got very close to the maximum 30 frames per second that EZCam offers. On the other hand, we were able to run the camera on a 166 MHz Pentium machine quite smoothly and found it very fun and easy to handle.The bottom line is that the Ezonics EZCam is a very affordable and highly useful peripheral.

The device boasts 20 bands of frequency adjustments (10 for each channel) to improve the performance of everything from classic LPs to modern CDs and MP3s. Each EQ slider is positioned one octave apart from the others--from 39 Hz to 16 kHz--to correspond with the entire range of human hearing. To adjust the vocal or instrumental balance of a favorite song, merely move the matching sliders up or down (each features 12 dB of boost or cut) until the right level is reached. Identification is simple thanks to the illuminated LEDs (one for each slider). Plus, the device offers a multicolor spectrum analyzer, which interprets the signal levels of the sliders and displays them onscreen. The analyzer not only helps you monitor the audio output, but it also looks ultra-cool when the lights are low.The EQ200 features two A/V inputs that offer the ability to control traditional audio sources, such as a CD player or turntable, along with the audio channels of video sources like VCRs or DVD players. To select an audio source, the listener merely presses the A/V button to the ""in"" position, while leaving it ""out"" controls the video source. Note that the EQ200 only affects the audio of DVD players or satellite systems. It has no impact on the picture, nor does it include any video-type connections. Users can also connect two cassette decks to the unit through the dedicated Tape 1 and Tape 2 inputs and outputs.The EQ200 plugs into your stereo through your receiver's Tape Monitor Loop input. As such, it offers a number of functions specifically designed for connected cassette decks, including a Tape 1-2/Tape 2-1 button that assists you when making tape copies with one deck or dubbing between a pair of tape decks. Listeners don't have to forfeit the traditional recording functions of their cassette decks, either, as the EQ200's tape outputs facilitate recording from the radio, CD, or other sources. Other functions include EQ record, which lets you make a tape copy using a customized equalization curve, and the non-cassette-specific EQ bypass, which allows the user to make comparisons between ""equalized"" and unequalized"" sounds.So of the missing piece to your audio puzzle is the ability to fine-tune your music to meet your demanding tastes, the EQ200 may be a good fit for your system. The device measures 16.56 by 3.5 by 11.88 inches (W x H x D) and is covered by a two-year warranty.What's in the BoxEQ200 graphic equalizer, two 34-inch stereo RCA cables, warranty/registration sheet, user's manual.",AudioSource

Rubber feet allow the entire unit to sit solidly on a flat surface, but there's also a sliding clip that can attach to the top of a notebook screen, bookcase or other mounting spot.The QuickCam Pro comes in parallel-port and USB versions. I tested the USB model, and installation was simple. The camera's capture software features an excellent interface and a large preview window; it's probably the best image-capture software I've seen with any video camera. The manual focus ring provides a wide and accurate focal range.The camera has a maximum resolution of 640x480 pixels in 24-bit color. In my tests, still-image quality was excellent. Logitech gives you a wide range of image-adjustment options and also automatically optimizes every still-image capture to improve quality. The results are clear, sharp images that display good contrast.The quality of captured moving images was not as good. It is almost impossible to avoid blur, and at the highest resolutions, I was only able to achieve frame rates of 5 frames per second (fps) or less. However, at 160x120 in 16-bit color, I was able to get about 24fps-good enough for video conferencing.The QuickCam Pro also comes with NetMeeting for Internet video conferencing; Web publishing software from Ixla; Adobe PhotoDeluxe 2.0; Digital Arts & Sciences' ImageAXS for cataloging; RealPlayer for video e-mail; and software for creating Desktop themes.While the Logitech QuickCam Pro doesn't match the image quality and performance of the Vista Imaging ViCAM on our WinList, it bests our previous WinList choice for low-end digital video camera, the Xirlink C-It Mobile.

With hard drives becoming ever more cavernous and file sizes becoming more bloated each year, it's a wonder those atrociously slow floppy drives still come standard on every computer. Maybe it's time you moved up to something faster, better, and more capacious. A Zip 100, you say? Maybe last year. But why bother with that when you can get a Zip 250?As you likely have gathered from the name, Iomega's Zip 250 uses 250 MB disks for incremental data backup. Since the media is removable, you can buy new disks when you need more storage instead of buying an entirely new drive. The 250 MB capacity is a much more reasonable standard for shuttling around files than the 1.44 MB diskettes used by a typical floppy drive.You might be worried about purchasing a drive that uses a parallel interface, as that's the port most printers occupy. Iomega thoughtfully has designed the Zip 250 with a pass-through port, meaning you can attach the drive to the PC and then attach a printer to the Zip drive. It worked flawlessly in our tests. The drive comes with both an AC adapter and a parallel cable, along with one 250 MB Zip disk--everything you need to get started.Zip drives always have been designed well, and the Zip 250 is exceptional in this regard. There's a well on the side for the power plug so it doesn't protrude from the jack. This makes it possible to stand the drive on its side if it's taking up too much space lying flat.Zip products have been around long enough that the software for them has had plenty of time to mature. The included CD-ROMs contain useful tools like Copy Machine, which lets you copy a Zip disk using a single Zip drive, and a one-step backup/restore utility, which easily backs up files from your hard drive.

The recorder also includes volume adjustment and an earphone jack.In our tests of the MB002, we found the optimal recording distance was between 1 inch and 2 feet from the microphone. Sound quality was only adequate, as recorded voices were sometimes unclear. In these cases, words sounded fuzzy but were still comprehensible.

With this software, connecting our Visor to the Internet to check e-mail was as  easy as entering a phone number, account name, and password. However, we were  not able to connect our Visor to an alternate ISP whose settings were not  preconfigured. (Obviously, we cannot fault Handspring for the limitations of  third-party software, but we do fault them for not including software at  all.)If you want to stay connected while you're on the road, the 33.6 Kbps  modem module is a must-have accessory.--Mike BrownPros:Easy to set up and useConnects your Handspring Visor to the Internet via an ordinary phone lineCons:No communication software included",Handspring

Being able to play music while lounging on the patio is more common place than luxury. However, simply connecting an extra speaker to an amplifier is not the solution, as its speakers added to an amp the resistance (also known as impedance) is lowered and amplifiers have a limit as to how low of a resistance they can handle. Extra speakers cause the impedance (ohms) to drop, stressing the amp beyond its limits. When this situation exists damage to the circuitry, amp shutdown, and even the risk of the amp burning up and catching fire can occur.

When this situation exists damage to the circuitry, amp shutdown, and even the risk of teh amp burning up and catching fire can occur. This is a high price to pay for music enjoyment.Using a speaker selector can avoid damaging your amp, however ordinary speaker selectors use resistors in series which limit the high frequencies so you hear less detail in the music.

Guaranteed functional and guaranteed for 30 days. Description Allied Telesis' offers twisted pair hubs intended to connect IEEE 802.3 10Base-T network segments through one unit. Each hub has one twisted pair port specifically designed with an uplink (cascading) capability supporting a Media Dependent Interface (MDI/MDI-X) crossover switch. These mini hubs utilize the latest IC and Surface Mount Technology (SMT), which increases functionality and reliability. Additionally, these hubs are very small in size yet they provide the complete functionality of large hubs including packet regeneration and network partitioning. The packet regeneration results in a higher performance network by regenerating preamble, retiming the data packets and extending collision fragments to ensure collision enforcement by all nodes. Each segment automatically detects the polarity of the receive pair and reverses should the pair be incorrectly installed. The IEEE defined link integrity test function continually monitors the receive pair to ensure link continuity. It also includes a partitioning capability where each segment automatically disconnects itself after repeated collisions are detected. These mini hubs support jabber lock-up protection on all interfaces, preventing transceiver lock-up resulting from packets that exceed the maximum packet length. Network diagnostic LEDs are provided on the front of the mini hubs to aid in monitoring system and network performance.",Allied Telesis

The D-Link DWL-650 PC card Type-II 11 Mbps 802.11b wireless LAN adapter, known as the D-Link Air for short, gives you back your mobility, letting you connect to your home or office wireless network from whichever desk (or couch) you happen to be at. Plus, as wireless networks continue spreading to hotels, airports, and even coffee shops, it will help you keep connected no matter how far you travel.The DWL-650 installed easily, as a PCMCIA card should. We just ran the setup program from the included CD and plugged the card into an empty Type-II slot on our notebook PC. Windows XP immediately recognized the card and installed the drivers. Then, using the D-Link configuration utility, we configured it for our specific LAN. Once connected to the LAN, the little green LED on the end of the card stopped blinking, telling us we were good to go. The printed manual and online help gave helpful guidance on getting the card installed and connecting to our network.As we tested our wireless setup, we reveled in the freedom the D-Link Air gave us. Using it in a two-story house, we were able to go from room to room, never losing our Internet connection. We even could go outside on the patio and browse the Web from a chaise lounge. Of course, the card worked equally well in an office environment, letting us take our notebook from the conference room to the lunchroom without losing our network connection.In general, we found that the construction of the walls between the wireless card and the access point had as much to do with reception quality as did distance. So, for instance, if you're separated from the access point by several thick walls, reception will be much poorer than if a glass partition is all that separates you. The manufacturer suggests a range of up to 328 feet indoors and up to 984 feet outdoors, and we found that to be a decent approximation of the maximum range you can expect. The D-Link control utility has a graphical status bar that shows the wireless signal strength, so it's easy to know when you've wandered too far.At 11 Mbps, the speed's plenty fast for most uses, like browsing the Web, accessing a file server, updating a database, etc. You can also configure it to transmit at slower speeds, depending on your network environment. The card supports both 64-bit and 128-bit WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) encryption, a vital feature that keeps your communications secret.The D-Link Air will keep you well-connected whether at work, at home, or through a public WiFi (wireless fidelity) network at places like an airport or coffee shop. Since it's a PCMCIA card, it's easy to swap in and out if you need to use a wired connection in some places and wireless in others. Bottom line, if you have a notebook PC and have access to wireless capabilities, you'll love the freedom of movement this little card delivers.--Ken FeinsteinPros:Easy installationUses IEEE 802.11b standard for broad compatibility with wireless networksSupports 64-bit and 128-bit encryptionGood rangeCons:Not as fast as a 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet wired connection",D-Link

On songs such as the opening mission statement, ""That's Where I  Belong,"" as well as ""The Teacher"" and ""Darling Lorraine,"" Simon flexes  polyrhythmic nuances that measure how completely his music now fuses its  familiar folk-rock origins with the more elastic influences gathered from  Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. That achievement seems effortless,  thanks to his remarkable 11-piece stage band, which likewise reflects Simon's  musical diaspora through its multinational makeup.As the show's front man, Simon proves more relaxed and playful than was often  the case earlier in his career. Whether illustrating key lyrics with exaggerated  hand gestures, or pulling rank with a deadpan delivery of ""Old"" (his funny,  unapologetic look at the other side of the generation gap), Simon radiates  authority. The song list manages to capture all of the new album's highlights  (especially the brilliant, tragi-comic ""Darling Lorraine"") with ample room for  solid new versions of earlier solo songs and Simon & Garfunkel hits.--Sam  Sutherland",

The Stowaway keyboard is a full-size keyboard when open but folds instantly to about the size of your iPAQ. This portable keyboard has the same key spacing as a standard desktop keyboard so it's comfortable to use. Plus, at only 7.9 ounces it won't weigh you down.This Stowaway keyboard is compatible with Compaq iPAQ 3100, 3600, and 3700 series Pocket PCs. See note below about compatibility with 3800 series Pocket PCs.Installation of the Keyboard application onto your Compaq iPAQ is done simply via Setup Assistant from the included CD-ROM. Because the Stowaway keyboard only needs power while it is actually being used, the effect on the overall battery life of your iPAQ will be minimal.To operate the keyboard with your handheld, click the Stowaway keyboard open from its folded position, lay it flat, and slide the keyboard parts together (it's separated into thirds for folding). Then, simply attach your handheld and start typing in a text-based program.You can do virtually all your work without taking your fingers off the keyboard with the Stowaway. The four custom keys on the right side of the keyboard (Inbox/Notes, Contacts/Word, Calendar/Excel, Tasks/Money) are preprogrammed shortcut keys to activate certain applications, but they can be customized with the Keyboard application.Placing the Stowaway keyboard on a firm, flat surface offers the best results, because of the folding design. However, you can use it on your lap as long as the keyboard is supported by a magazine or book across its open expanse.--Agen G.N. SchmitzSpecial note to customers:An adapter is available that will allow the Targus Stowaway portable keyboard for Compaq iPAQ Pocket PCs to support newer iPAQ models in the 3800 series.

This results in lenses that meet much higher standards than the rest of the industry.Aspherical lens elementsNikon introduced the first photographic lens with aspherical lens elements in 1968. What sets them apart? Aspherical lenses virtually eliminate the problem of coma and other types of lens aberration--even when used at the widest aperture. They are particularly useful in correcting the distortion in wide-angle lenses. In addition, use of aspherical lenses contributes to a lighter and smaller lens design. Nikon employs three types of aspherical lens elements. Precision-ground aspherical lens elements are the finest expression of lens-crafting art, demanding extremely rigorous production standards. Hybrid lenses are made of a special plastic molded onto optical glass. Molded glass aspherical lenses are manufactured by molding a unique type of optical glass using a special metal die technique.Internal FocusingImagine being able to focus a lens without it changing in size. Nikon's IF technology enables just that. All internal optical movement is limited to the interior of the non-extending lens barrel. This allows for a more compact, lightweight construction as well as a closer focusing distance. In addition, a smaller and lighter focusing lens group is employed to ensure faster focusing.

The camera pairs a 5-megapixel sensor with a high-quality custom-designed 4x zoom lens for photos with clarity that rivals film.First, a note about naming conventions: this camera is also known as the E-20 and the E-20P. TheNin E-20N signifies that this is an NTSC (North American) model. European versions are called E-20P because their video-out feature is designed to work with PAL televisions. The models are otherwise identical.Design and OpticsThe E-20N looks and feels like a high-quality professional film SLR. It's hefty, weighing in at 37 ounces, due both to the glass in the lens and the camera's cast-aluminum body. Unlike other digital cameras in its class, the lens on the E-20N is not removable, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. Digital SLRs from other manufacturers typically include just the camera body, and adding a quality lens is a substantial additional expense. Olympus asserts that having removable lenses exposes the sensor to dust, but digital SLRs from Nikon, Canon, and Fuji all use removable lenses, and dust isn't a widely reported problem with those models. Olympus also states that using a lens specifically designed for a digital camera produces sharper images than using a lens designed for a 35mm SLR. This makes sense, since the imaging sensor in a digital camera is smaller than a 35mm negative.The lens on the E-20N contains aspheric elements, ED elements, and a Gauss-type lens group--features designed to maximize image quality, and typically found only on high-end lenses. In 35mm terms, the lens zooms from 35-140mm, with a maximum aperture of f2.0 to f2.4, depending on how much zoom is used. If you're looking for even more flexibility, add-on lenses ranging from 28mm to 420mm are available.To compose your photos, either use the swivel-mounted 1.8-inch LCD on the back of the camera or look through the traditional-style ground-glass viewfinder. Most digital SLRs use a mirror to send light to either the viewfinder or the CCD sensor, but the Olympus uses a beam-splitter--basically a prism--to illuminate the viewfinder and the sensor simultaneously. The LCD monitor also sits on a hinge, letting you tilt it up 90 degrees, or down 20 degrees, so you can take pictures from unusual camera angles while still accurately framing the scene.The 5-megapixel CCD sensor on the E-20N is one of the highest-resolution sensors currently available and captures images with filmlike detail. Like most CCDs, this unit retains a design limitation handed down from the device's origins in television cameras: it is an interlaced chip, which means the camera reads information from the CCD twice--once for all pixels in the sensor's even rows, and again for all the odd rows. The camera then merges these two sets of data into a single image. This technology limits the top shutter speed in 5-megapixel mode to 1/640th of a second--reasonably quick, but not fast enough for high-speed photography. To get around this limitation, Olympus has added a progressive-scan feature to the camera. In simple terms, this mode only reads information from half of the pixels on the sensor (and limits your photos to 2.5 megapixels), but increases your shutter speed to a screaming 1/18,000th of a second, increasing the camera's flexibility tremendously.More FeaturesShooting options on the E-20N include all of the typical modes you'd expect to see on a high-end consumer digital camera: program, aperture priority, shutter priority, and manual shooting modes. Other user-controlled settings include exposure compensation, metering mode, ISO setting, flash, white balance, and focus. Users can leave white balance on auto, select from a number of kelvin temperatures, or manually create a preset. The built-in flash features red-eye reduction, auto, fill-in, and off modes. External flashes can connect to the E-20N through the hot-shoe on top of the camera. Exposure compensation can be set from -3 to +3 EV in one-third EV increments. The ISO can be set to 80, 160, or 320. Also, an autobracketing feature takes three pictures, one over exposed and one under exposed, and allows you to set the exposure compensation up to one EV step in either direction, in one-third EV step increments. A histogram function lets you view exposure information after you capture an image, giving you instant feedback about how to improve your picture-taking skills. A large internal buffer allows the E-20N to take up to take up to four shots in sequence at three frames per second, even when set to record images as uncompressed TIFFs.PowerThe E-20N uses four AA or two CR-V3 lithium batteries--a set of the lithium batteries is included. These batteries have a long life, but they aren't rechargeable, so they're not a good long-term solution unless you're an extremely occasional photographer. We strongly recommend using a set of rechargeable nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries.Storage and TransferUnlike most other digital cameras, the E-20N uses both SmartMedia and CompactFlash (Type I and II, including the IBM Microdrive) for storage, and can use both simultaneously. The camera has slots for both types of cards, and a menu setting lets you toggle between the slots for storage. The included 32 MB SmartMedia card holds 11 pictures at full resolution with normal compression or two pictures in uncompressed TIFF mode. The card can be erased and reused over and over, but if you plan to take more than 11 photos on an outing, then you'll want a higher-capacity card--a 256 MB CompactFlash card, for example, holds around 80 photos at default settings.Contents and Recommended AccessoriesThe kit includes the camera, lens hood, lens cap, video, and USB cables, strap, lithium disposable batteries, wireless remote control, 32 MB SmartMedia card, basic manual, and software on CD, including Adobe PhotoShop Elements. Everything you need to get started is included in the box, but to make the most of your camera, we strongly recommend a higher-capacity memory card, rechargeable batteries, and a carrying case. Compatible accessories for this camera are listed near the top of this page.ConclusionFor serious 35mm SLR users considering a digital camera, the E-20N is a natural choice. The camera feels extremely solid, and controls are logically arranged. Thanks to the high-resolution sensor and fine lens, picture quality is excellent. Admittedly, there are still some areas where the E-20N can't keep up with a film camera, but unless you're a sports or news photographer who needs to blast through a roll of film in five seconds, or someone who requires an unusual lens, this Olympus should offer the features and performance you need.--Shane BurnettPros:5-megapixel sensor captures filmlike detailFeatures, appearance, and performance are all similar to a 35mm SLRDual memory card slots let you choose your format--or load both slots for more capacityCons:Though the lens is of extremely high quality, competitors' models feature detachable lensesRechargeable batteries and more memory are necessities for long-term use",Olympus

Products that managed to deliver truly cleaner AC power were thousands of dollars in price, out of reach for most people. Enter Head Monster Noel Lee. An uncompromising audiophile, Lee joined forces with Richard Marsh, the world&#x92;s foremost expert on AC power, to develop affordable solutions to AC power problems. The result? Monster Clean Power.Internal view showing the various filters and advanced circuitry. Pictured is the HTS5100.Rear view showing the component-assigned outlets. Pictured is the HTS5100.More Than Just Surge! -Monster Clean PowerThe following overviews of Monster&#x92;s isolated, specially tuned Clean Power filters demonstrate the methodology behind Clean Power&#x92;s development. The higher the Clean Power stage, the more advanced the noise filtration. The more advanced the noise filtration, the higher the level of component-to-component isolation.Isolated Clean Power Digital FiltersOptimized to reduce noise generated by digital equipment digital filters isolate digital components from connected analog audio and video components for maximum rejection of interference.Isolated Clean Power Video FiltersOptimized to reduce noise generated by video equipment, video filters isolate video components from connected digital and analog audio components for maximum rejection of interference.Isolated Clean Power Analog Audio FiltersOptimized to provide maximum noise rejection for sensitive analog audio components, audio filters isolates audio components from connected digital and video components for maximum rejection of interference.Isolated Clean Power Ultra-High Current FilterOptimized for maximum noise rejection, ultra-high current filters provide maximum current to high power components such as surround sound amplifiers.Reference Home Theater PowerMonster PowerCenters also offer the most comprehensive home theater system protection available, featuring higher joule ratings for faster acting, full capacity surge protection.

It's a simple, one-time-cost solution to the problem of annoying telemarketing calls.Here's how it works: Given that more than 90 percent of telemarketing calls are placed with computer assistance, when either you or your answering machine answers the phone, the Telezapper emits a special tone that tells the computer your number has been permanently disconnected. Telemarketing companies that use automated dialing systems typically remove disconnected numbers from their calling lists, and as your phone number is eliminated from more and more telemarketing lists, you'll notice fewer calls. Of course, not all telemarketers use predictive dialing systems, and those that do will undoubtedly work to evade the Telezapper, but it can be a partial solution.For the most part, regular callers are unaffected by the Telezapper, but it may ""zap"" calls from other organizations that use the same predictive dialing technology (such as charities, pollsters, and automated emergency weather systems) and from callers who use certain types of calling cards. (For more information, click FAQ, or frequently asked questions, in the left navigation bar.)In our tests of the Telezapper, installation took just seconds. We plugged the Telezapper into our phone line and our phone into the Telezapper and then connected the AC adapter. It was that simple. There are no moving parts to wear out and no batteries to replace.We field-tested the Telezapper for several weeks, and during that time, we noticed a significant reduction in telemarketing calls. Of course, this was not a scientific study, and we cannot with certainty attribute our results to the Telezapper, but the device seemed to work well for us.The Telezapper includes a phone cord, power adapter, and instructions. Privacy Technologies backs the device with a one-year warranty.--Mike Brown, with Ariel Meadow StallingsProsReduces telemarketing calls placed by predictive dialing systemsDoesn't interfere with most normal callsInexpensive, one-time-cost solutionExtremely easy to install and useConsMay ""zap"" some desired callsAnnoying beep every time the receiver is lifted",Privacy Technologies

Within a system the distance between sources and switching devices is usually short and pre-terminated cables usually fit the task--but speakers are a different story. Distance to speakers varies and in some cases pre-terminated cables which have ends connected during manufacturing are either too long or too short, using un-terminated cable is the best way to ensure that cables are the proper length. Using bare wire at the amplifier/AV receiver and speakers is not the best connection, as the strands of wire can get separated and the exposure of any copper in the cable can errode over time. In order to make the best connection the bare wire needs to be terminated.The Right ConnectionMaking the right connection is quick and easy with Monster QuickLock connectors; these specially designed connectors give the right termination for all your speaker connections. Simply slip the wire through the specifically designed jacket, bend the wire over and screw the termination. Your wire is now crimp in place and ready to connect to your amplifier and speakers.Terminations are available in Banana Plug, Angled Spades, and FlexiPin to fit whatever type of terminal is on your amplifier and speakers. Each termination is gold plated for long-lasting corrosion protection and to optimize the performance from your speakers by making a solid connection.

And should listeners not have a suitable outdoor environment--the speakers aren't waterproof, so uncovered areas aren't ideal--they can move inside and use them as bookshelf stereo speakers or rear speakers in a surround system. The speakers even come with individual brackets for mounting on a wall.Each speaker includes a 0.75-inch titanium-laminate cone tweeter that reproduces high notes and dialogue at the peak of precision. The tweeter also boasts an oval orientation called Elliptical Oblate Spheroidal (EOS), which results in a wider horizontal dispersion of sound. The idea is simple: turn every seat, no matter where it's located, into the best seat in the house or yard. Meanwhile, the mids and lows radiate from the professionally engineered 4-inch WeatherPlas cone woofers. Additional audio enhancements include FreeFlow flared ports that minimize distortion and thump and a Straight-Line Signal Path (SSP) crossover network that divides the audio signal with minimal processing for a better overall sound.The N24AWII's technical specifications include a maximum recommended amplifier power of 100 watts, a frequency response of 75 Hz to 20 kHz, and a crossover frequency of 3,000 Hz.

If you have an extra TV, VCR, or perhaps powered speakers, remember, they need surge protection. Just like the equipment you use in your ""main"" entertainment area, these components are vulnerable to power surges that can damage their ability to perform, or cripple them entirely.Monster's A/V PowerCenter  AV200 Provides The Most Complete Power Protection for Your Components.With Monster's Audio/Video PowerCenter  AV200, you can place your TV, powered speakers, or VCR in a separate location away from your main system and still be protected from power surges (with a high 1110 joule rating). Monster's Dual Mode Plus  design is the heart of AV200's superior surge protection.  Here's how it works.  When a surge, or other excessively high voltage, hits the wires that carry power to your equipment, Metal Oxide Varistors (MOVs) will limit the voltage forwarded to the connected equipment to a safe level.  Then, if that voltage is high for too long, a thermal fuse will disconnect the line wire from the connected equipment permanently.  This assures that the connected equipment will not be exposed to any damaging high voltages.

B000063S40,Sony MVCFD200 FD Mavica 2MP Digital Still Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom,499.95,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417EVYMHR2L._SX300_.jpg,{'Camera &amp; Photo': 10655},"[['Electronics', 'Camera & Photo', 'Digital Cameras', 'Point & Shoot Digital Cameras']]","Sony brought easy digital photography to the masses when it introduced the Mavica--a digital camera that stored digital pictures on standard floppy discs. This updated version boasts a 2-megapixel sensor and a Memory Stick slot, plus the charm and simplicity that made the original a hit.Optics and ResolutionThe FD200's 2-megapixel sensor captures enough detail for sharp prints at sizes up to 8 by 10 inches. For the typical family photographer, 2 megapixels is a great balance between price and performance. If you want a camera with even more resolution, forget about using low-capacity floppy discs and step up to a CD-recording model instead--try Sony's MVC-CD300 or MVC-CD400.The autofocus lens features both a 3x optical zoom and a 2x digital zoom. Remember, however, that digital zoom tends to reduce the sharpness and detail of your image, so it's a good idea to use it sparingly.To save space, there's no traditional optical viewfinder to look through. Instead, to compose your images or review shots you've already taken, the FD200 uses a big 2.5-inch color display. The advantage to using the LCD to frame your shots is that the screen lets you see exactly the picture you'll capture. The disadvantage is that you can't turn off the screen and just use the optical viewfinder to extend battery life. Fortunately, the included rechargeable battery holds a relatively good charge.More FeaturesThe FD200 is clearly designed for point-and-shoot simplicity, but there are several options for more adventurous photographers, including manual focus with macro, adjustable ISO and white-balance settings, exposure compensation, and the ability to shoot black-and-white, sepia, solarized, and negative images.PowerThe FD200 uses Sony's excellent InfoLithium battery system, which not only holds a respectable charge, but also displays on screen how many minutes of power remain. Both the battery and the charger are included. Because the battery is unique to specific Sony models and can be nearly impossible to find when on the road, we strongly recommend getting a spare if you're planning to take the camera on extended outings.Movie ModeIn movie mode, the camera captures silent video clips. The limited duration and resolution of your movies guarantees that this feature won't replace your camcorder, but it's perfect for when you just want to capture a quick movie and e-mail it to a friend or relative.Storage and TransferImages are stored on standard floppy discs, which makes transferring pictures to your computer a snap. Take the picture, wait for the disc to stop whirring, then eject it from your camera and pop it into your computer's floppy drive. For safekeeping, it's best to transfer images to your hard drive and periodically archive your photos using a CD-R drive.Though they're available everywhere and have become dirt-cheap, floppies aren't without their problems. First, their 1.4 MB capacity is dismal by today's standards. A 2-megapixel photo actually contains 6 MB of information, which means a disc can't hold even a single uncompressed photo. Using standard JPEG compression, only four photos fit on each disc, so plan to bring a big stack of bulky floppies on each outing. To make matters more frustrating, some new computers (iMacs, for example) don't even come with floppy drives anymore.To get around these problems, the FD200 also includes a slot for Memory Sticks, Sony's proprietary memory-card format. A 128 MB stick is approximately one-fifth the size of a floppy disc, yet it holds around 200 images at the camera's default settings or over 20 uncompressed TIFF images. To transfer images to your computer, simply attach the included USB cable between your PC and your camera. Your computer should automatically recognize your camera and let you move the pictures to your hard drive. If you own a Sony desktop or laptop, your computer may already have a built-in Memory Stick reader.Most folks will probably buy the Mavica for the simplicity of its floppy drive, but switch to the Memory Stick slot when on extended outings.SizeConsidering the internal floppy drive and nonretracting 3x zoom lens, the Mavica is reasonably compact at 5.6 by 4.1 by 3.1 inches, though it weighs in at a hefty 19 ounces.Contents and Recommended AccessoriesThe package includes the camera, lithium-ion rechargeable battery, NPF-330 AC adapter-battery charger, video and USB cables, shoulder strap, and lens cap.The camera does not come with any storage media, so you'll need either a floppy disc or a Memory Stick to start shooting. Otherwise, everything you need to get started is included in the box. To make the most of your camera, we recommend: a carrying case, a high-capacity Memory Stick or stack of floppy discs, and, for extended outings, a spare battery. Compatible accessories for this camera are listed near the top of this page.--Shane BurnettPros:2-megapixel resolution is perfect for most usersFloppy disc storage for ultimate simplicityLithium-ion battery holds a good chargeCons:Movie mode lacks soundFloppies are big, bulky, and low capacity, though the Memory stick slot solves this problem.",Sony

It can be mounted vertically or horizontally for easy placement in any car.Everything you need for great bass in your car, with no hassle.Click to enlarge.Remote level control included.Mount BassLink vertically or horizontally.Click to enlarge.Designed to deliver low frequencies in virtually any car audio system, BassLink truly has universal appeal. Small in size but big in output, BassLink requires a mere .75 cubic feet of trunk space yet produces enough bass to wake up the neighborhood.BassLink consists of a 10-inch subwoofer, 10-inch passive radiator and a 200-watt Class D amplifier housed in a rigid polymer enclosure, all carefully engineered to work together as a unique, integrated system. The extremely versatile BassLink accepts both speaker- and line-level inputs, and it provides an internal low-pass filter, proprietary signal processing and abundant amplification.The BassLink system features a servo-control circuit that continually monitors the voice coil's position in the magnetic gap and prevents the distortion that occurs when a conventional woofer is overdriven. By integrating cone-excursion information with the instantaneous demands of the music, BassLink can extract loud and deep bass from an enclosure smaller than any before.BassLink includes a fixed, 2nd-order, high-pass filter that eliminates the possibility of over-excursion below Fb, the resonant (tuned) frequency of the vented box. This allows the excursion-monitoring circuit to focus on the excursion at the more meaningful frequencies at and above Fb. The result is a significant increase in bass output.User-adjustable controls allow listeners to set the system's response to achieve optimum performance based on the vehicle's cabin gain or transfer function. These controls include: a 0- or 180-degree phase switch; a continuously variable electronic low-pass filter that is adjustable between 70 and 100Hz; variable input sensitivity; and Bass EQ that provides for adjustments between +3 and -6dB. BassLink's frequency response in a typical vehicle is 20 to 100Hz (+/-3dB), but this varies according to the vehicle and user adjustments. At maximum gain, the system can accept inputs as low as 250mV.BassLink can accept up to four channels of input--to provide nonfading bass--either from line-level signals through four RCA jacks or from high-level signals through a pair of Molex connectors, allowing BassLink to be easily connected to OEM systems. If using the speaker-level inputs, an audio-sense circuit will turn on the amplifier whenever a signal is present. If the RCAs are used, a 12-volt, remote-turn-on lead is required. The system has barrier strip connections for power, ground and remote turn-on.What's in the BoxInfinity Basslink 200-Watt Powered Subwoofer System (Black), Bass level control, Wiring harnesses, Mounting feet, Mounting bolts, Instructions",Infinity

The binoculars are designed to fit perfectly in your hands and have a rubber coating for nonslip grip and protection from damage. The focus dial is center-mounted and the image stabilizer controls are easily accessible from either hand. Canon's optical image stabilization technology eliminates shake and reduces curvature of field. The image stabilizer operates with a CR123A Lithium battery. The lenses are coated with Super Spectra multicoating that improves image quality by maximizing contrast and minimizing color smear.Image Stabilization and MoreWith any high magnification binoculars, most users will experience frustrating image shake. Unless fixed to a tripod, image shake can render high magnification binoculars useless. Canon's IS technology is remarkably effective at eliminating this problem and is widely used by the television industry with Canon's professional broadcast quality video recording equipment. A special VAP (Vari-Angle Prism) corrective IS system sits between the objective lens group and the porro prism on each side of the binoculars. Within thousandths of a second of the binoculars being moved from their optical axis by vibrations, a detection system activates the IS mechanism. The VAP shape alters to refract or 'bend' the light path by precisely the right amount, thus fully compensating for the vibration. It is this essentially immediate response that effectively suppresses image shake.Super Spectra CoatingA number of optical factors affect the brightness of an image, including the amount of incidental light that is reflected by the lens. An uncoated lens will refelect away as much as 8% of the incidentail light, significantly dimming the image. Canon's Super Spectra Coating prevents that reflection.What do the numbers mean?15x50? 8x25? The two numbers used to describe any pair of binoculars are their magnification &#x97; 8x, 12x, 15x and so on &#x97; and the diameter of their objective lenses &#x97; 25mm, 36mm, 50mm, and so on. The larger the first number is, the larger the object will appear to be in the objective lens. For instance, if you use a 10x lens and look at an object that is 100 yards away, it appears to be the same size as an object located just 10 yards away. The second number, the size of the objective lens, is important because the larger the objective lens, the more light it can admit for brighter, more detailed images, and the better suited they will be for lowlight situations.A look inside",Canon
