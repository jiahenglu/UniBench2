It has original game play, but uses skills that you have obtained from playing your old favorites like hearts, spades and rummy. Because Five Crowns has five Royal Families - the Stars, the Clubs, the Hearts, the Spades and the Diamonds - yes, five suits in the old usage, it allows a more equal chance of making a book or a run, effectively giving each player more possibilities to readjust their hand so as to go out. Good players are able to take advantage of this and win more than an average number of games. The play starts with three cards and 3s are wild; next hand has four cards and 4s are wild....working up to the last hand when Kings are wild. Each of the royal families is portrayed in original art and has its own colors. The Renaissance designs result in cards that are beautiful to hold in your hand and give a ""collector"" feel to the game. Five Crowns is a fast paced, ingenious new game in eleven rounds. You may be winning, but before coveting the winner's crown, beware...

Vibration-dampening rubber grips soak up the shocks, making it easier to hold the line, and the counterbalance design places the weight squarely over the shoe. Need a fast cut? Flip the orbital adjustment switch to position four (maximum swing) and cruise through material at up to 3,100-inch-long strokes per minute. For more precise cuts in high-visibility areas, use the zero setting (orbitless motion) for a cleaner edge. Thanks to an adjustable blower on the right side, sawdust is whisked out of the line of sight, a feature we always appreciate in a jig saw. The shoe locks on this saw seem sturdier than the one on DeWalt's cordless model and the shoe easily adjusts--with a tool-free lever--to slide forward or backward for flush cutting, and also bevels 45 degrees to both sides. No wrenches are required to change blades, either: simply pull and turn the top, remove the old blade, and replace it with the desired universal or T-shank--a handy, timesaving design that is unique to DeWalt.--Justin Paul",DEWALT

It features 60 teeth with alternating top bevels and TiCo high-density carbide tips, negative hook angles for maximum control, and Freud's insulating, Perma-SHIELD coating.LU91R010 Thin Kerf Sliding Compound Miter Saw BladeAt a Glance:Ideal for crosscutting materials 1/2 to 2-3/4 inches thickHeavy-duty plate with laser-cut, anti-vibration slotsTough Perma-SHIELD coating reduces friction and heat buildupTechnical Specs:CoatingPerma-SHIELDDiameter10""Teeth60 ATBArbor5/8""Kerf (K).090Plate (P).071Depth of CutNegative Hook Angleminimizes climbing for better controlThin Kerfrequires less power and allows for faster feed rateNegative Hook Angle for Fine Finishes with Sliding Miter SawsThis thin-kerf blade's 60-tooth alternating-top-bevel (ATB) configuration features teeth that face both left and right. The blade's teeth also feature five-degree, negative hook angles, which helps prevent the blade from being too aggressive. This configuration also works to push your work piece down and towards the fence of your saw for smooth, accurate feeding. And because thin-kerf blades remove less material than standard carbide blades, they require less horsepower to produce smooth, accurate results when cutting.This blade is designed for optimal performance when crosscutting wood that is 1/2 to 2-3/4 inches thick, and it also performs well in laminate. This blade can also rip wood or be used with chipboard and plywood, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.090 kerf.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis thin-kerf saw blade's 60 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""crosscut blend."" Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge in the face of demanding crosscut applications, this blend is extra hard--due to including more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends--and it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

The aluminum/magnesium alloy on the gear case cuts down on the tool's weight, and the glass-reinforced nylon handle makes it a bit lighter, too--but let there be no doubts: when it comes to results, this is the same heavy-duty, ridiculously powerful, no-nonsense tool it's always been. The shooter is built with a stacked design--meaning the drill's interior parts stack on top of each other--which makes replacing parts (like a switch) much easier to do as the whole drill doesn't need to be taken apart. The handle is designed so you can hold it two ways--either pistol-grip or with the palm of your hand resting on the top back portion--making the drill an extension of your arm. As a result, you can really get behind it while still easily reaching the trigger with your fingers. And the finger slots add comfort. The shooter's top-quality chuck is a Jacobs (the best). It's a two-handed chuck, which, for the types of applications this drill is built for, is exactly what you want. The carbon brushes are also easy to access and change.One of our favorite new features on this tool is the long and superflexible Quick-Lok cord. If the cord gets cut or damaged, you simply unplug the damaged cord and replace it with the cord from any other Quick-Lok Milwaukee tool.

Well, not with a wormdrive saw like the HD5860. When you turn this baby on the torque from the motor actually twists the saw towards the material and with the power of a 13-amp motor, the wormdrive's cuts are fast, smooth and easy. Another important aspect of the wormdrive is that the blade is located on the left side of the tool, unlike sidewinder saws which are on the right side. This provides for an easily viewable cutting area without the need to extend your body over the saw housing or twist your arms and shoulders in order to watch the path of the blade.A dual front sight helps to guide the saw along a marked line when cutting at 90, 45 or 60 degree angles. That's right, you can now cut stock up to 2 inches deep when set at a 60-degree angle, an exclusive feature of the HD5860. The durable cast aluminum motor and gear housing and an easily accessed oil refill port all make for a long-lasting and durable tool, something you've come to expect from Skil.--C.

The blade can also handle ripping wood and working with laminate, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials.

And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup.

Freud is one of the few manufacturers of woodworking tools in the world that produces its own MicroGrain carbide with titanium, called TiCo -- a combination of titanium and cobalt. Freud develops different types of carbide for each application to maximize the cutting life and performance of the tool; and Freud also operates one of the most modern product development research centers in Europe. By overseeing the entire manufacturing process from start to finish, Freud guarantees some of the highest quality, most advanced products in the industry.About this Blade StabilizerWhen making a high precision cut, any amount of rim vibration can mean the difference between a masterpiece and scrap. This Freud saw blade stabilizer is precision machined and balanced to give an added amount of stability, which not only improves the cut, but also makes the saw cut quieter -- and extends its cutting life between sharpenings. This stabilizer can be used on blades with a 7-inch diameter and larger, with a 5/8-inch arbor. Stabilizers should only be used on stationary saws and should never be used on hand held portable saws. A saw blade is not included with this stabilizer.ApplicationsUse this stabilizer to minimize rim vibration and improve the cut of your stationary saw. It also makes the saw cut quieter, and prolongs the saw blade's life between sharpenings.Key Tech Specs:For use with saws 7-inches or larger, 5/8-inch arborNot for use on hand-held portable sawsPrecision machined and balancedWarrantyThis stabilizer is covered by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.",Freud

This is your go-to set for efficiently creating dadoes and grooves in a wide range of materials from hardwood to laminate. Boasting thick MicroGrain carbide tips and an anti-kickback design, the set's two outside blades can be resharpened for long-term accuracy. For added versatility, the kit cuts grooves spanning 1/4 to 7/8 inch and includes a shim set.Resharpening Blades for Smooth, Splinter-Free DadoesThe perfect dado set for the fine cabinetmaker or weekend woodworker, the Freud SD208 produces dadoes and grooves that meet with flush, even edges. So you can be assured of precise cuts every time, the set is equipped with precision-grade features, starting with two proprietary outside blades that can be resharpened to deliver accuracy for the long term.These high-quality eight-inch, 12-tooth blades with 5/8-inch arbors cut dadoes and grooves that are clean, flat, and virtually splinter free. Cuts made by these blades are accurate the first time, saving you from making repeated passes over the same workpiece.Flexibility for Cutting Hardwoods, Laminates, and MoreThe Freud SD208 accommodates a wide range of materials, so you can use it from project to project. And because it requires less power to feed, it is ideal for use with underpowered saws. Use it to create dadoes and grooves in hardwood, softwood, chip board, plywood, and laminate (not recommended for non-ferrous materials).Two-Wing Chippers, Spacers, and Shim Set for Fine AdjustmentsThe set's included chippers/spacers (three 1/8-inch chippers and three 1/16-inch spacers) save you time and energy. With their two-wing design, they efficiently remove waste material and smooth the edges of your workpiece. Plus, they allow you to fine-tune your cuts from 1/4 to 7/8 inch, so you have accurate control over the desired width.And with the Freud SD208's included shim set, you never have to give up making dadoes with a workpiece that's too thin to fit the width of your dado blades. This handy shim set expands the range of your kerf adjustments, giving you even greater control for achieving a flawless finished workpiece.Anti-Kickback Design for Safe OperationThe quality of this dado set is enhanced by its anti-kickback design, which gives you an added margin of safety while you work.MicroGrain Carbide Tips for Long-Lasting PerformanceSo you can get maximum performance out of this set, the blade components are constructed with Freud's TiCo Hi-Density Carbide. This means the blades can withstand numerous sharpenings and still retain their precision. And a Tri-metal Brazing process gives the blades impact resistance, so they last for the long term without dulling (a condition that can cause torn wood and uneven cuts).About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

We knew that Forrest makes some of the best blades on the planet, but we truly weren't prepared for the gorgeous cut we got with this blade.On the back side of plywood, we had zero tearout. When we cut a length of 8/4 oak, it felt like a hot knife through butter, and the result was too good to be believed: smooth as glass, completely free of circle marks of any kind, and it looked like it had been sanded already - cut after cut after cut.You can pick up a miter saw blade for a tenth of this price, of course. It will cut. But it won't cut like this. And it won't last as long as this blade will, not by a long shot. Because it's made of double-hard C-4 carbide, it holds it edge for what seems like forever, and it resharpens beautifully.Forrest spends a good deal of time on each blade, ensuring that it's as straight as can be, and that's part of what you're paying for.

Although drill-bit sharpening systems often fail to live up to our expectations, we're here to bear witness for the truth of the Drill Doctor's claims: it really does sharpen old bits in just a couple of minutes. The 500SP (also known as the Tradesman) works on conventional, split-point, and masonry bits. It can sharpen bits from 3/32 to 1/2 inches in size, and though the machine will also work for 3/4-inch bits, we'd recommend buying the Professional model for doctoring these big boys, as it comes with a special chuck the 500SP lacks. Both models--the 500SP and the Professional 750SP--allow you to choose between a 118- and 135-degree sharpening angle. Operation is fairly simple, but to make sure no one has trouble figuring it out, the Drill Doctor comes with a how-to video. Anyone who frequently wears down drill bits is going to appreciate the savings this handy machine can offer. Using sharp bits instead of dull ones also increases the life of your drill, because sharper bits require less work to make the same hole.

Not only does it give you a nice textured effect, but it effectively hides imperfections, nails, and tape lines in a single application. This alone can save you a ton of time.On the downside, hoppers like this are a little unwieldy. When they're full of drywall it can be quite heavy-this is not a one-handed operation. On this model, the hopper handle is bolted on at the top, which makes it a little uncomfortable to hold over long periods of time. The gun works with what the manufacturer refers to as a ""four-finger grip""; in other words, you have to exert some pressure to make it work. (If you are worried about the comfort and ease of operation, you may want to shell out a little more money for Kraft's Super-Pro system, which is a little easier to operate.)Note that the hopper is angled, which allows you to tilt the whole thing upward so you can spray ceilings. This is a nice feature, and it will save you a lot of headache trying to drywall ceilings by hand.As hoppers go, however, this is an inexpensive option that will get the job done.--Josh DettweilerWhat's in the BoxHopper, gun, air tips",Kraft Tool

The surface is not predrilled for mounting, so you'll have to drill and mount your saw yourself. Construction is rugged steel, and the welds are solid, as are the rollers on the extensions. In order to reduce weight, Trojan has kept the legs fairly thin, and as a consequence the unit isn't as burly as some models. But depending on the saw model you intend to mount, and where you plan to set up (indoors, outdoors, or in the shop), this may or may not be an issue.

The BoWench gives you a fast, one-person way to straighten decking boards. This is great, because decking material--whether redwood, cedar, or another, more exotic rot-resistant wood--is often warped, especially in 14- to 16-foot lengths. To operate the BoWrench, you simply fit the tool on a joist, swing the lever arm, and release. You can either push or pull boards into alignment, and when the handle is perpendicular, the tool locks in place, holding the board securely and leaving you free to drive nails or screws. The BoWrench is better than toenailing. Burying nails in the sides of decking to close gaps works, but it gives water more ways to enter the decking, which eventually leads to rot. With the BoWrench, you'll save time, create a longer-lasting surface, and maximize material. Using the special cam attachment (sold separately), the BoWrench replaces the clumsy beater block as the best way to close gaps in tongue-and-groove plywood and paneling.--Jon Groebner",BoWRENCH

And, SmartTool can take abuse other levels can't, because its components are made of high strength materials and you can reset it to factory accuracy with the touch of a button.Many versatile optionsIf you can imagine times you'd like to have both a small digital torpedo level and a longer level, the SmartTool Module fills the need.&#xA0;The SmartTool Module can be used as a stand alone level or it can be placed in the optional American I-beam level in lengths of 24 inches, 48 inches or 96 inches.M-D's top-quality red aluminum I-beam levels have been assured of excellence among construction professionals for more than three-quarters of a century. Easily attached or removed using only a screwdriver or coin, the versatility of this product can be appreciated in almost any application.The simple, SmartTool patented field calibration procedure can be performed using one button, any reasonably level surface, and just a couple of minutes. When used with the optional magnetic bracket, the SmartTool Module will stay on saw blades, metal pipes, buildings, machinery or anything made of iron or steel allowing hands free measurement.Simple to useSmartTool permits you to find level and plumb in two ways.&#xA0;For quick references, use the sensitive bubble vials.For highly precise work, use the digital display on the Sensor Module.&#xA0;It provides accuracy to 1/10 of a degree.But the real advantage of the SmartTool is that it also reads all the other angles bubble vials don't.&#xA0;So when you are not dealing with level or plumb, SmartTool quickly tells what the angle is and what the angle needs to be.&#xA0;And only SmartTool allows you to measure angles three different ways:degrees, percent slope, and pitch (rise over run).Read in DegreesSet saw blade angles to a fraction of degree accuracy with SmartTool.&#xA0;Assure there is no gap when you join 2 cuts together with .1 degree accuracy. You can easily duplicate a stair angle for setting handrails and never again will you be measuring top and bottom to make sure stair treads and rails are parallel.Percent Slope and PitchIn the percent slope mode the SmartTool allows you to read angles to meet requirements for sewer connections,ADAramps, and grading.And showing compliance is merely a matter of pointing to the display. SmartTool also gives you roof pitch readings -- in inches of rise per foot of run -- right on the display.No two-handed measurements, no conversion calculations, and no mistakes.Listen and Level Audio FeatureHave tasks where you really can't see the SmartTool but need instant feedback?&#xA0;Then turn on the audio beeper.&#xA0;When turned on with a single button, SmartTool lets you hear when your task is at level or plumb.&#xA0;This can be great when shimming projects, leveling buildings, pool tables or other projects where you need immediate feedback but are not in a position to see the display.This can leave your hands free to adjust, nail, or screw the project in place when you hear the beep telling you it is where you want it.HoldThe hold button makes it easy to measure in areas where the digital display is not visible.&#xA0;Take the measurement, push the hold button, and then bring the SmartTool in front of you to see your reading.",M-D Building Products

The new Speed Slot hole saw outperforms all competitors in wood cutting, plug removal, and metal cutting applications. The patent pending Speed Slot features a staircase design for easy plug removal. The slot is wider than most and is placed lower on the hole saw with multiple leverage points to easily eject the plug with a standard screwdriver. The hole saw is 10-percent taller than the previous model to deliver cleaner cuts through two-by lumber. The Speed Slot efficiently removes saw dust and chips while producing a fast cut and preventing the plug from getting stuck in the saw. The new hole saw also features up to twice the life of the previous model when cutting metal. An enhanced tooth geometry, a thin kerf design and an advanced coating contribute to the efficiency of the cutting process by removing material faster, therefore generating less heat while cutting (3/4-Inch, 7/8-Inch, 1-1/8-Inch, 1-1/2-Inch, 1-3/4-Inch, 2-Inch, 2-1/4-Inch, SNAP-BACK Arbors: 2L and 5L, One arbor adaptor).",Lenox Tools

And, SmartTool can take abuse other levels can't, because its components are made of high strength materials and you can reset it to factory accuracy with the touch of a button.Many versatile optionsIf you can imagine times you'd like to have both a small digital torpedo level and a longer level, the SmartTool Module fills the need.&#xA0;The SmartTool Module can be used as a stand alone level or it can be placed in the optional American I-beam level in lengths of 24 inches, 48 inches or 96 inches.&#xA0;M-D's top-quality red aluminum I-beam levels have been assured of excellence among construction professionals for more than three-quarters of a century. Easily attached or removed using only a screwdriver or coin, the versatility of this product can be appreciated in almost any application.&#xA0;The simple, SmartTool patented field calibration procedure can be performed using one button, any reasonably level surface, and just a couple of minutes. When used with the optional magnetic bracket, the SmartTool Module will stay on saw blades, metal pipes, buildings, machinery or anything made of iron or steel allowing hands free measurement.Simple to useSmartTool permits you to find level and plumb in two ways.&#xA0;For quick references, use the sensitive bubble vials.For highly precise work, use the digital display on the Sensor Module.&#xA0;It provides accuracy to 1/10 of a degree.But the real advantage of the SmartTool is that it also reads all the other angles bubble vials don't.&#xA0;So when you are not dealing with level or plumb, SmartTool quickly tells what the angle is and what the angle needs to be.&#xA0;And only SmartTool allows you to measure angles three different ways:&#xA0;degrees, percent slope, and pitch (rise over run).Read in DegreesSet saw blade angles to a fraction of degree accuracy with SmartTool.&#xA0;Assure there is no gap when you join 2 cuts together with .1 degree accuracy. You can easily duplicate a stair angle for setting handrails and never again will you be measuring top and bottom to make sure stair treads and rails are parallel.&#xA0;Percent Slope and PitchIn the percent slope mode the SmartTool allows you to read angles to meet requirements for sewer connections,ADAramps, and grading.&#xA0;And showing compliance is merely a matter of pointing to the display. SmartTool also gives you roof pitch readings -- in inches of rise per foot of run -- right on the display.&#xA0;No two-handed measurements, no conversion calculations, and no mistakes.Listen and Level Audio FeatureHave tasks where you really can't see the SmartTool but need instant feedback?&#xA0;Then turn on the audio beeper.&#xA0;When turned on with a single button, SmartTool lets you hear when your task is at level or plumb.&#xA0;This can be great when shimming projects, leveling buildings, pool tables or other projects where you need immediate feedback but are not in a position to see the display.&#xA0;This can leave your hands free to adjust, nail, or screw the project in place when you hear the beep telling you it is where you want it.HoldThe hold button makes it easy to measure in areas where the digital display is not visible.&#xA0;Take the measurement, push the hold button, and then bring the SmartTool in front of you to see your reading.",M-D Building Products

Hitachi's coil roofing nailer is an exception. This nailer has two metal plates, or what Hitachi calls Steel Body Wear Protectors, at the back and front of the machine that act as bumpers to protect the tool's condition and extend its life--which makes sense, when you think of the beating a roofing nailer is subjected to. No question about it, Hitachi's NV45AB is a good gun. We like the way the nailer fires, the guide plate that helps keep nails flush, and how the rubber safety valve in the nosepiece keeps debris out. The grip's great: it's wrapped around the handle and made of a porous rubber that really sticks to your hand so you don't have to worry that sweating will take a toll on comfort or productivity. And of all the nailers we've looked at, this one's definitely in the running for most handsome, with a nice silver finish. But don't buy it for how it looks; this nailer's solid feel and action are reason enough.--Michael Shilling",Hitachi

Offering an unmatched combination of power, comfort, and durability, this heavy-duty pneumatic nailer is the perfect tool for framers, general contractors, custom homebuilders, and remodelers. Delivering more than 10&#37; more power-per-pound than the competition, the PowerMaster Plus easily drives nails through engineered lumber, so it will make short work of everything from framing and sheathing to fence and deck construction.The F-350S PowerMaster Plus 30-Degree Framing NailerAt a Glance:Drives 2"" to 3-1/2"" 30-degree nails into tough lumberCompact size fits between 16"" studs, joists, and raftersOn-tool depth of drive adjustmentBalanced for premium performance1-year limited warranty on housing and cap partsCenter of gravity is close to the trigger for optimal balance.Compact size easily fits between 16"" joists, rafters,and on-center studs.Professional-Grade Tool Simplifies Framing JobsIdeal for professional framing work, the PowerMaster Plus drives 2"" to 3-1/2"" 30-degree clipped and full-head papertape nails with .113"" - .131"" diameters in engineered lumber, so you can handle decking, sub-assembly blocking, sheathing, and trussing of all types. And when you're tackling a big job, you'll be grateful for the PowerMaster Plus's high-capacity one-piece aluminum magazine, which holds up to 84 nails (two strips).Sequential Operation for Greater EfficiencyWith the PowerMaster Plus you can choose either manual or sequential operation and drive up to 12 nails per second--the barrel-shaped nose will ensure an easy line of sight when nailing. To keep things simple, a durable work contact element adjusts on the tool--not the compressor--for precise depth of drive, so you'll be sure to get the right depth for the job. To top it off, the contact element is specially designed to securely grip wood during toenailing.Big Power in a Compact PackageWeighing just 8.4 pounds and operating at 80-120 psi (5.5-8.3 bar), the PowerMaster Plus delivers over 10&#37; more power per pound than the competition. Offering all the muscle you need to drive through engineered lumber. This tool is surprisingly easy to handle.To save you time and energy, the PowerMaster Plus features an ergonomic design that places the center of gravity close to the trigger, providing optimal balance and the lowest recoil of a tool of its size. And with a soft-grip handle, it's comfortable to hold, even during all-day jobs.Incredibly compact, the PowerMaster Plus has a height of just 13.3"", so it will easily fit between 16"" joists, rafters, and on-center studs. A rafter hook--which is located on the magazine and can be moved out of the way when it's not needed--makes it easy to hang the PowerMaster Plus on your tool belt, ladder, or rafter.For further ease of use, this pneumatic nailer features an adjustable air-deflector cap and a main valve that improves airflow and performance over a wide range of operating conditions. A bolt-on-end plug makes for quick service and secure compressor attachments.The PowerMaster Plus is backed by a 90-day limited warranty on wear parts, a six-month limited warranty on magazine parts, and a one-year limited warranty on housing and cap parts.About Paslode: Providing Professionals with Innovative SolutionsWith more than 70 years of experience, Paslode provides the standard by which other pneumatic and cordless fastening systems are measured.

This versatile blade handles crosscuts with chipboard, plywood, or laminate, and can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.126 kerf.The extra-large, flat teeth featured on this blade leave a smooth, splinter-free finish that eliminates the need for sanding and jointing. This large-tooth design also allows the blade to be safely sharpened more times, prolonging the life of the blade and saving you money. And the large gullets between these teeth ensure easy chip removal.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis heavy-duty rip saw blade's 24 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""ripping blend."" This blend offers a mix of improved density, hardness, corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that's ideally matched to the demands of ripping large quantities of thick, hard wood.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--once again, saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge in the face of demanding crosscut applications, this blend is extra hard--due to including more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends--and it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life.

Each flat tooth is followed by four alternating-top-bevel (ATB) teeth that are particularly well suited to crosscutting, and large gullets between the teeth ensure effective chip clearance.This blade is designed for optimal performance when crosscutting materials that are 3/4 to 3-1/2 inches thick or ripping materials that are 3/8 to 1-1/2 inches thick. It makes quick work of hard- and softwood, plywood, and chipboard. It can also handle laminates or tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 1-inch arbor and produces a 0.126 kerf.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis combination saw blade's 60 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""combination blend."" Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge for longer when faced with a variety of applications, this blend includes just a little bit more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends. And it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

It's ideal for working with hard- or softwoods that are 3/4 to 2-3/4 inches thick, and it can be used in gang-rip operations. This versatile blade handles crosscuts with chipboard, plywood, or laminate, and can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 1-inch arbor and produces a 0.169 kerf.The extra-large, flat teeth featured on this blade leave a smooth, splinter-free finish that eliminates the need for sanding and jointing. This large-tooth design also allows the blade to be safely sharpened more times, prolonging the life of the blade and saving you money. And the large gullets between these teeth ensure easy chip removal.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis heavy-duty rip saw blade's 30 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""ripping blend."" This blend offers a mix of improved density, hardness, corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that's ideally matched to the demands of ripping large quantities of thick, hard wood.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--once again, saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup. Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup is another little convenience that translates into longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

Based on the results of extensive computer simulations, this grind is ideally suited to working with thick stock and stacks of single- or double-sided laminates. The blade's teeth also feature 6-degree, negative hook angles, which helps prevent the blade from being too aggressive and further reduces the possibility of chipping.This blade is designed for optimal performance when cutting stacks of 3/4-inch laminates and melamine, and it's also an excellent performer in plywood and chipboard. This blade can also crosscut or rip wood, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.126 kerf.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis thick-stock saw blade's 60 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high density carbide ""laminate blend."" Formulated to extend tooth life in the face of work with laminates, melamine, and solid surfaces, this blend is extra hard--due to the proportion of high density-tungsten carbide that goes into it--and it still offers the mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.Silver I.C.E. Coating Resists Corrosion, Heat, and Resin BuildupThis blade is finished with Freud's Silver I.C.E. coating, which resists corrosion for improved performance over time. This unique coating also resists heat buildup, protecting your saw and your work surface and preventing the blade from warping. It also helps prevent resin or ""pitch"" buildup.Since gummy pitch buildup causes extra drag on the motor of your saw, less buildup means longer tool life and longer blade life. It also means less downtime for blade cleaning, so you get jobs done faster.This industrial saw blade is backed by Freud's limited lifetime warranty.About Freud: A History of Innovative ManufacturingAn industry leader for more than 50 years, Freud America, Inc. is a manufacturer and marketer of superior carbide cutting tools for the woodworking industry.

And thanks to the unique side-grind on each tooth, the blade smoothes work surfaces as it cuts through them. This leaves you with a super-smooth, high-quality finish that doesn't need to be sanded down.This blade is designed for optimal performance when crosscutting wood that is 1/4 to 1-5/8 inches thick or when cutting chipboard and plywood that is less than 1-inch thick. The blade can also handle ripping wood and working with laminate, and it can tackle thinner or thicker materials. However, some loss of surface finish may occur when it is used outside its ideal range. It has a 5/8-inch arbor and produces a 0.116 kerf.Well-Balanced, Anti-Vibration DesignThis Freud blade is precision balanced and pretensioned for truer cuts under heavy loads. It also features laser-cut, anti-vibration slots that reduce chatter for a cleaner finish, longer blade life, and reduced noise while you work. And because the entire blade is laser cut from high-strength steel, you can trust that it will stay stable, flat, and true, even after prolonged use. Furthermore, this well-balanced, anti-vibration design means there's no need to use add-on stabilizers with this blade.High-Density Carbide for Maximum Cutting PerformanceThis cut-off saw blade's 72 teeth are finished with tips made from Freud's application-specific TiCo high-density carbide ""crosscut blend."" Formulated to help the blade maintain a sharp cutting edge in the face of demanding crosscut applications, this blend is extra hard--due to including more high-density tungsten carbide than other TiCo blends--and it still offers the full mix of improved corrosion resistance, heat resistance, and impact resistance that you expect from TiCo.With teeth that start out sharper and deliver improved edge retention, the blade can go longer between sharpening, and will hold up longer--saving you time and money.Perma-SHIELD Coating Reduces Friction and Heat BuildupBuilt to withstand tough use in less-than-ideal conditions, this blade is finished with Freud's red Perma-SHIELD--a non-stick coating that reduces friction and nearly eliminates the heat buildup that excess friction can cause. By providing complete thermal insulation, this coating protects your tools and your work surface. And it resists binding when the blade is used for large-volume cutting applications, which reduces blade warp.As a lubricating feature, Perma-SHIELD allows the blade to spin freely while reducing stress on the motor and carriage of your saw. In addition, this coating helps prevent debris collection and resin or ""pitch"" buildup.

The SFN30 is a lightweight gun (only 3.6 pounds) and comes with a comfortable rubber grip, making it an easy gun to work with all day without suffering hand/arm fatigue. It fires 15-gauge finish nails ranging from 1 to 2 inches in length. Using the depth-of-drive adjustment, we were able to achieve a uniform countersink with every shot. We really appreciate Senco's Neverlube design, which requires no oiling and eliminates the chance of getting oil overspray on the woodwork--it's a great innovation that the competition (to remain competitive) will have to pick up on soon. The SFN30 comes with a no-mar safety tip and allows you full access to the firing chamber to clear jams should the need arise (it didn't in our tests). There's also a handy built-in belt hook. While most Senco nailers come with an adjustable exhaust port, this model doesn't, a bit of a disappointment.

Designed to fit your style, function flawlessly, and last a lifetime, this ETL Indoor rated fan has a 42-inch five-blade design to help keep a small room or office comfortable all year round. It comes with one 3-inch downrod with 3/4-inch diameter and also includes a 180-watt, three-bulb light fixture and three 60-watt candelabra bulbs.Three-Position Mounting System: Flush, Standard, and Angled.Beacon Hill Ceiling FanAt a Glance:/td>WhisperWind MotorInstaller's Choice 3-Position Mounting System180W 3-light fixtureUses three 60W candelabra bulbs (included)Can be installed without light fixtureLimited lifetime warrantyAirflow4,600 CFMElectricity Use62 WAirflow Efficiency74 CFM/WEnergy Efficiency EverydayThe Beacon Hill ceiling fan is designed for energy efficiency everyday, which means it gets better performance using less energy. Other ceiling fans may claim efficiency with low-wattage motors, but they move little air. Competitors also compromise on blade pitch and blade surface area, which makes a fan even less efficient. Thankfully, this Hunter ceiling fan harmonizes precision craftwork with a one-of-a-kind motor for optimum heat displacement and air movement.Exclusive WhisperWind MotorThe WhisperWind motor found in the Beacon Hill Ceiling Fan delivers ultra-powerful air movement with whisper-quiet performance, so you get the cooling power you want--without the noise you don't.Like all Hunter motors, the WhisperWind motor features copper wiring that has a balanced temperature rise in each winding. This eliminates hot spots for increased motor reliability and longevity. Additionally, the motor utilizes precision-engineered large and small ball bearings that provide minimal resistance and friction for virtually noise-free operation. For even greater efficiency, the motor features an internal impeller that facilitates air circulation to keep the motor cool and ensure long life.Combined, these exclusive Hunter motor technologies result in 15&#37; improved performance, 20&#37; longer life, 20&#37; less noise, and up to 47&#37; savings on cooling costs.Savings Without SacrificeLike all Hunter ceiling fans, the Beacon Hill can save you up to 47&#37; on cooling costs. To put this in perspective, the wind chill from a Hunter ceiling fan will keep you as cool at 82 degrees as you would be at 76 degrees without a ceiling fan. That means you could set your thermostat 6 degrees higher and cut your energy bill almost in half--without sacrificing comfort. Use the Beacon Hill during the summer months to keep cool, or run it clockwise during the winter to circulate warm air.Durable Fan is Easy to Install and OperateThe Beacon Hill comes with an Installer's Choice three-position mounting system, so you can hang the fan in a standard, flush, or angled position. It can be installed with or without its 180-watt three-light fixture, which uses three 60-watt candelabra bulbs (included). A standard three-speed pull chain allows for quick and easy adjustments.Built to last, the Beacon Hill is backed by Hunter's famous Limited Lifetime Motor Warranty.About Hunter: Building the Best Since 1886Long before the widespread use of electricity, people around the world counted on Hunter ceiling fans for cool comfort. Today, Hunter combines this heritage of 19th-century artistry with 21st-century design and innovation to create quality ceiling fans that look good and function quietly. And Hunter ensures all of its home comfort products--air purifiers, humidifiers, thermostats, portable fans, and bath exhaust fans--are as tough on the inside as they are beautiful on the outside--just like every Hunter fan since 1886.What's in the BoxHunter Beacon Hill Ceiling Fan with light fixture, 3-inch downrod, and three 60-watt candelabra bulbs.Beacon Hill Ceiling Fans20436 42-Inch White with White/Light Oak BladesS20430 42-Inch Antique Brass with Rosewood/Medium Oak Blades20431 42-Inch Inch Brushed Nickel with Maple/Cherry Blades20434 42-Inch Inch Bright Brass with Rosewood/Medium Oak Blades",Hunter Fan Company

It goes without saying that a flashlight defeats its own purpose if it can't be trusted, which is why so many people spend a little extra for this four D-cell Mag-Lite. We've dropped ours off ladders, kicked it down stairs--just generally abused the thing--and it lights up now just as readily as it did when we first turned it on. Speaking of which, the on/off switch is one of the first things to fail on generic flashlights. Mag-Lite's switch is rubber coated and weather protected; frankly, it seems incapable of ever wearing out, even after thousands of clicks. Plus, twisting the flashlight's head gives you an option between a tight beam and a floodlight. More importantly, the combination of a supertough krypton gas lamp and high-quality reflectors provides unusually bright light. There's also an extra lamp in the tail cap so you've always got a backup--how many other flashlights deliver that?But the Mag's indestructibility is its main selling point. Mag Instrument builds its flashlights with ultrastrong aluminum alloy cases that have been anodized both inside and out to resist rust. High-quality O-rings at both openings keep water away from the batteries. It's hard to imagine damaging one of these lights. Think of it this way: if, as one of our customers suggests, there were a kingdom of flashlights, Mag-Lite would be crowned king.--Jon Groebner",MagLite

Designed to fit your style, function flawlessly, and last a lifetime, this ETL Indoor rated fan has a 42-inch five-blade design to help keep a small room or office comfortable all year round. It comes with one 3-inch downrod with 3/4-inch diameter and also includes a 180-watt, three-bulb light fixture and three 60-watt candelabra bulbs.Three-Position Mounting System: Flush, Standard, and Angled.Beacon Hill Ceiling FanAt a Glance:/td>WhisperWind MotorInstaller's Choice 3-Position Mounting System180W 3-light fixtureUses three 60W candelabra bulbs (included)Can be installed without light fixtureLimited lifetime warrantyAirflow4,600 CFMElectricity Use62 WAirflow Efficiency74 CFM/WEnergy Efficiency EverydayThe Beacon Hill ceiling fan is designed for energy efficiency everyday, which means it gets better performance using less energy. Other ceiling fans may claim efficiency with low-wattage motors, but they move little air. Competitors also compromise on blade pitch and blade surface area, which makes a fan even less efficient. Thankfully, this Hunter ceiling fan harmonizes precision craftwork with a one-of-a-kind motor for optimum heat displacement and air movement.Exclusive WhisperWind MotorThe WhisperWind motor found in the Beacon Hill Ceiling Fan delivers ultra-powerful air movement with whisper-quiet performance, so you get the cooling power you want--without the noise you don't.Like all Hunter motors, the WhisperWind motor features copper wiring that has a balanced temperature rise in each winding. This eliminates hot spots for increased motor reliability and longevity. Additionally, the motor utilizes precision-engineered large and small ball bearings that provide minimal resistance and friction for virtually noise-free operation. For even greater efficiency, the motor features an internal impeller that facilitates air circulation to keep the motor cool and ensure long life.Combined, these exclusive Hunter motor technologies result in 15&#37; improved performance, 20&#37; longer life, 20&#37; less noise, and up to 47&#37; savings on cooling costs.Savings Without SacrificeLike all Hunter ceiling fans, the Beacon Hill can save you up to 47&#37; on cooling costs. To put this in perspective, the wind chill from a Hunter ceiling fan will keep you as cool at 82 degrees as you would be at 76 degrees without a ceiling fan. That means you could set your thermostat 6 degrees higher and cut your energy bill almost in half--without sacrificing comfort. Use the Beacon Hill during the summer months to keep cool, or run it clockwise during the winter to circulate warm air.Durable Fan is Easy to Install and OperateThe Beacon Hill comes with an Installer's Choice three-position mounting system, so you can hang the fan in a standard, flush, or angled position. It can be installed with or without its 180-watt three-light fixture, which uses three 60-watt candelabra bulbs (included). A standard three-speed pull chain allows for quick and easy adjustments.Built to last, the Beacon Hill is backed by Hunter's famous Limited Lifetime Motor Warranty.About Hunter: Building the Best Since 1886Long before the widespread use of electricity, people around the world counted on Hunter ceiling fans for cool comfort. Today, Hunter combines this heritage of 19th-century artistry with 21st-century design and innovation to create quality ceiling fans that look good and function quietly. And Hunter ensures all of its home comfort products--air purifiers, humidifiers, thermostats, portable fans, and bath exhaust fans--are as tough on the inside as they are beautiful on the outside--just like every Hunter fan since 1886.What's in the BoxHunter Beacon Hill Ceiling Fan with light fixture, 3-inch downrod, and three 60-watt candelabra bulbs.Beacon Hill Ceiling Fans20436 42-Inch White with White/Light Oak BladesS20430 42-Inch Antique Brass with Rosewood/Medium Oak Blades20431 42-Inch Inch Brushed Nickel with Maple/Cherry Blades20434 42-Inch Inch Bright Brass with Rosewood/Medium Oak Blades",Hunter Fan Company

You can set the light timer to one, five, or ten minutes, and the motion sensor itself may be adjusted to give you more or less sensitivity (so it doesn't light up every time a car drives by). The weather-resistant finish means it's going to look good for a while, too.If you're looking to save a little money on outdoor lighting by installing a motion-detector, this is a great option that actually looks good.

Designed for professionals and weekend warriors alike, this top-notch product offers maximum usability in all types of measuring situations. Equipped with a range of useful goodies, the highly-portable tape will meet just about anyone&#x92;s needs. Standard features include a lockable blade for precise measurements and minimal slippage, a belt hook for easy access, a 1-inch wide blade for easy reading, and 16-inch and 19.2-inch stud center markings. Plus, Stanley has added a heat-treated spring to increase the tape&#x92;s lifespan.Two unique features make this tape a standout. First, the blade is coated with mylar to help it stand up to abrasion associated with repeated use. Second, the patented Tru-Zero hook doubles as a pivot for drawing circles and arcs, and it automatically adjusts to handle inside or outside measurements. What this means is that the hook on the end has a small amount of play that is equivalent to the thickness of the hook blade. This is so that when you measure with the hook inside a stop (like a window jam), the front end of the hook is the zero point. When you hook it over the edge of a board, the zero point becomes the back of the hook.Stanley does make a host of other measuring tools that may be worth checking out. At such a great price, most users can&#x92;t go wrong with this one.What&#x92;s in the Box25-foot by 1-inch measuring tapeThe Stanley StoryThe Stanley Works, originally a bolt and door hardware manufacturing company located in New Britain, Connecticut; was founded in 1843 by Frederick T. Stanley. A few years later, in 1857, Frederick&#x92;s cousin, Henry Stanley, founded The Stanley Rule and Level Company. In 1920, The Rule and Level Company merged with The Stanley Works and would go on to become it&#x92;s famous Hand Tools Division. Over the years, The Stanley Works has produced some of the most innovative and useful tools ever made. Among these tools are the Bailey Plane, the Surform shaper, the PowerLock tape rule and most recently the FatMax line of products. Today, more than ever, Stanley continues to be an industry leader in tool innovation. In 2001, Stanley introduced more than 100 new products, bringing to 400 the number of new products introduced in the past four years. As a direct result of Stanley&#x92;s commitment to excellence, Stanley was awarded the Prestigious Golden Hammer Award, presented for New Product Innovation in both 2000 and 2001.",Stanley

The company owes its success to the inventive genius of its founder and namesake, Albert J. Dremel. In his lifetime, Mr. Dremel owned 55 patents on a wide range of products from electric erasers to a gas-powered rotary lawn mower. His most famous and important invention was a high-speed rotary tool, dubbed the Dremel Moto-Tool. Compact, lightweight, and perfect for a wide range of jobs, the rotary tool was an immediate hit with hobbyists and eventually became accepted as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century. Today, the Dremel name remains synonymous with utility, durability, and innovation.What's in the BoxEngraver tool, letter and number template, and 9924 carbide pointThe versatile, easy-grip 290-01 lets you decorate and label a wide range of material, from tough metal to delicate glass.",Dremel

The company owes its success to the inventive genius of its founder and namesake, Albert J. Dremel. In his lifetime, Mr. Dremel owned 55 patents on a wide range of products from electric erasers to a gas-powered rotary lawn mower. His most famous and important invention was a high-speed rotary tool, dubbed the Dremel Moto-Tool. Compact, lightweight, and perfect for a wide range of jobs, the rotary tool was an immediate hit with hobbyists and eventually became accepted as one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century. Today, the Dremel name remains synonymous with utility, durability, and innovation.What's in the BoxFlex attachment, square drive nut, and instruction booklet",Dremel
