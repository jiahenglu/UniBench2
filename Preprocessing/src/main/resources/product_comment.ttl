        rdfs:comment  "Volvo Cross Country C303, (TGB11, A.K.A \"Terrängbil 11\", translated as \"Terrain Vehicle 11\"), is the base model of a range of military vehicles produced by Volvo. The car was developed in the late 60s based on the successful L-3314 series and went into production in 1974. This version was produced both as a 4x4 and a 6x6. An 8x8 was planned but dropped. Engines were the B30 (B20 in the prototypes) from Volvo's civilian cars. The C3 series feature portal axles with locking differentials resulting in very high ground-clearance (similar to the Unimog) and outstanding performance offroad. The cars are narrow to make it possible to navigate between trees and on narrow forest roads."@en .

The aim of the project was to construct a military tilt rotor aircraft with VTOL characteristics for use in World War II. For takeoff, the entire outer part of the wing could be rotated 90 degrees so that the propellers is directed straight up so that they would create a lifting force that would left the aircraft off the ground in a manner similar to that of a helicopter. Once in the air propeller would be rotated to a horizontal position and propel the aircraft forward."@en .

It was based on the 911 Turbo, and uses a similar twin-turbocharged engine, but features numerous upgrades, including engine upgrades, larger brakes, and stiffer suspension calibration. The GT2 is significantly lighter than the Turbo due to its use of rear-wheel drive instead of all-wheel drive, and the lightening or removal of interior components. As a result, the GT2 was the most expensive and the highest trim level within the 911 lineup."@en .

It was a twin-engine aircraft with a fuselage derived from the single-engine Curtiss Thrush. The Kingbird had two engine nacelles mounted on the struts on either side of the fuselage that braced the wing and the outrigger undercarriage. A distinctive design feature was the aircraft's blunt nose, located behind the propeller arcs. This allowed the engines to be mounted closer to each other and to the aircraft's centerline, therefore minimising asymmetrical thrust in case of an engine failure. For the same reason, the Thrush's single tailfin was replaced by twin tails on the Kingbird, and the main production model, the D-2 fitted a second horizontal stabilizer and elevator between th"@en .

It replaced the W20 8/40 PS, from which it inherited its OHV engine, developed by Ferdinand Porsche. At launch the W22 differed from its predecessor most notably on account of its swing rear axle, supported by lateral leaf springing, adopting a pattern established by Ferdinand Porsche during his time with the (at the time still independent) Austrian Steyr company. Another new feature in the W22 was the hydraulic braking system."@en .

Displayed alongside the Mitsubishi ASX, the two vehicles represented the company's vision for sporty, stylish crossover SUVs. However, while the ASX defined Mitsubishi's production plans, the RPM 7000 was a more radical styling exercise and an overt celebration of the company's motorsport heritage. The World Rally Championship-winning Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and the Dakar Rally-winning Mitsubishi Pajero provided the engine and drivetrain, while chief stylist Mike Desmond acknowledged the influence of Formula One in the \"nosecone\" front grille and hood.

During World War II's early stages, Volvo decided that a new, smaller car that could deliver good fuel economy would assure the company's future. A raw materials shortage during the war drove home the point that an automobile should be smaller, and also complicated Volvo's ability to mass-produce the product. In 1944, when the car was finally introduced to a car-hungry public, response was very positive and orders poured in from the Swedish population. It was another three years though, until 1947, before series production began."@en .

To fit in the bomb bay of a B-36, the GAM-71 was relatively small; its wings were folded when it was stowed in the bay. To mimic the radar cross-section of the B-36, it carried radar reflectors."@en .

It was of wooden construction and has fitted with a retractable nosewheel undercarriage. One feature of the design was that instead of a 2 + 2 seating, the pilot sat in front to the left, and all three passengers were on a bench seat to the rear of him. Alternatively, when being used as an air ambulance aircraft, it could carry a patient on a stretcher, which was loaded through a hatch in the aircraft's nose. The F.25 was evocative of the pre-war G.I design. The F.25 was based upon the design of the Difoga 421 aircraft, home-built and -designed secretly during World War II by Frits Diepen, a Ford garage owner from Tilburg,"@en .

Simca acquired the Poissy factory from Ford France (Ford Société Anonyme Française, the French subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company), along with the model line, in 1954.

Built in Zaragoza, Spain, the first Corsas were three-door hatchback and two-door saloon models, with four-door and five-door versions arriving in 1984. In mainland Europe, the saloon versions were known as the \"Corsa TR\" until May 1985. The basic model was called just the Corsa, which was followed by the Corsa Luxus, Corsa Berlina and the sporty Corsa SR. The SR receives a spoiler which surrounds the rear window, alloy wheels, checkered sport seats, and a somewhat more powerful 70 PS (51 kW) engine. Six years later, the Corsa received a facelift, which included a new front fascia and some other minor changes. The models were called LS, GL, GLS and GT."@en .

First flown in 1942, the N-9M (M for Model) was the third in a lineage of all-wing Northrop aircraft designs that began in 1929 when Jack Northrop succeeded in early experiments with his single pusher propeller, twin-tailed, twin-boom, all stressed metal skin Northrop Flying Wing X-216H monoplane, and a decade later, the dual-prop N-1M of 1939–1941. Northrop's pioneering all-wing aircraft would lead Northrop-Grumman many years later to eventually develop the advanced B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, which debuted in Air Force inventory in 1989."@en .

As a result, four of the CH-47Cs were upgraded to CH-47D status, and returned to service in 1995 with the Australian Army. The Army acquired two more CH-47Ds in 2000 and another pair in 2012.

Curtiss named the SO3C the Seamew but in 1941 the US Navy began calling it by the name Seagull, the same name as the aircraft it replaced (the Curtiss SOC a biplane type), causing some confusion. The British Royal Navy kept the Curtiss name, (Seamew), for the SO3C that they ordered. One of the US Navy's main design requirements was that the SOC Seagull's replacement had to be able to operate both from ocean vessels with a single center float and from land bases with the float replaced by a wheeled landing gear."@en .

The DH 108 featured a tailless, swept wing with a single vertical stabilizer, similar to the layout of the wartime German Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet rocket-powered point-defence interceptor. Initially designed to evaluate swept wing handling characteristics at low and high subsonic speeds for the proposed early tailless design of the Comet airliner, three examples of the DH 108 were built to Air Ministry specifications E.1/45 and E.11/45. With the adoption of a conventional tail for the Comet, the aircraft were used instead to investigate swept wing handling up to supersonic speeds. All three prototypes were lost in fatal crashes."@en .

The airship frame was made from spruce plywood laminated into girder sections, weatherproofed with varnish, and also fireproofed. These enclosed 21 gas bags. R31 was the largest British airship to fly before the end of the war, and the class remains the largest mobile wooden structures ever built."@en .

The original Hondamatic, like all following Honda automatics, featured sliding gears on parallel axes rather than planetary gears like most other automatic transmissions. The design preserved engine braking by eliminating a sprag between the first and second gears. It also featured a unique shifting action controlled by stator torque rather than traditional hydraulics. The Honda torque converter had a lockup, leading the company to sell the original Hondamatic (which had just two forward gear ratios) as a three-speed. The true three-speed H3 was launched in 1979."@en .

It was based on the earlier Lamborghini Urraco, but was distinguished from the Urraco by more angular styling. The Silhouette was the first Lamborghini to employ a targa top roof. The Silhouette later evolved into the similar looking but more successful Lamborghini Jalpa. The car had a 3.0 litre all-aluminium alloy Lamborghini V8 internal-combustion engine mounted transversely behind the driver.

        rdfs:comment  "The Ford Mustang is an American automobile manufactured by Ford. It was originally based on the platform of the second generation North American Ford Falcon, a compact car. The original 1962 Ford Mustang I two-seater concept car had evolved into the 1963 Mustang II four-seater concept car which Ford used to pretest how the public would take interest in the first production Mustang. The 1963 Mustang II concept car was designed with a variation of the production model's front and rear ends with a roof that was 2.7 inches shorter. Introduced early on April 17, 1964, and thus dubbed as a \"1964½\" by Mustang fans, the 1965 Mustang was the automaker's most successful launch since the Model A. The Mustang has undergone several transformations to its current sixth generation."@en .

        rdfs:comment  "Boss is the internal name for a family of large-displacement V8 engines from Ford Motor Company intended to compete with Chrysler Hemi engines and General Motors' 6.2-L Vortec engines. Originally, Ford developed the engine architecture under the name Hurricane; however, development of the engine was delayed due to its temporary cancellation in 2005. It was revived in early 2006 by Mark Fields and was given the new name of Boss in light of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In spite of this change, Ford has yet to officially market the engines with the Boss name in any production vehicle where they are to be used, instead referring to the engines by their displacement."@en .

        rdfs:comment  "The Aero L-60 Brigadýr (Czech: Brigadier) was a small, high-wing propeller-driven Czechoslovakian STOL utility aircraft developed for both civil and military use. A prototype, designated XL-60, with Argus As 10C engine, first flew on December 24, 1953, but it was not successful. The plane was thoroughly redesigned and the second improved prototype, with M-208B flat-six engine, flew on June 8, 1954. The aircraft's configuration bears a strong resemblance to the Fieseler Fi 156 \"Storch\" licence-produced in Czechoslovakia during and after World War II (as K-65 Čáp), and which this aircraft was intended to replace. By the end of production in 1960, 273 had been built, including an improved version, the L-160 with an all-metal tail."@en .

It replaced the single overhead camshaft (SOHC) OM601 engine.Unlike other Mercedes Benz diesels at the time that used a Bosch inline injection pump the OM604 used the Lucas electronically controlled rotary distributor injection pump (EVE) which is less reliable.The seals of the Lucas injection pumps become brittle over time and leak. Since the replacement of the entire injection pump is very expensive, a repair kit is offered in which the affected seals are replaced."@en .

        rdfs:comment  "The DAF F218 and later F220 is the name of a modular cab used on a series of medium-duty trucks produced by the Dutch manufacturer DAF from early 1970 until the mid-1990s. The names reflect the cab width in centimetres, at 218 and 220 cm (85.8 and 86.6 in) respectively. DAF's first tilting cab design, all in steel, it also benefitted from a new 8.25 L (503 cu in) diesel inline-six. After a thorough facelift with a new front clip in the style of the larger F241 series, the cab was renamed the F220 in 1976. The range was originally sold as the F1600 or F2000, with the new model F220 marketed as the F2300. Gradually, a number of other iterations appeared, with the range eventually stretching from the 1700 to the intercooled 2700 ATi."@en .
